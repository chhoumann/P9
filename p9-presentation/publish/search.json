Goal: Is there life on Mars? Experiments showed positive results, but the results were inconclusive and were not repeated due to budget constraints.\n1990s: Philosophical shift within NASA: “Is there life on Mars?” to “Did Mars ever have the conditions to support life as we know it?”\nIn 2004, the Mars Exploration Rover mission landed the rovers Spirit and Opportunity on Mars, which quickly discovered evidence of water on Mars.\nA few years later in 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission landed the Curiosity rover on Mars. This is the rover that we concern ourselves with in this project. Rover is equipped with a suite of instruments to study the Martian climate and geology and to search for organic material.\nOne of the instruments is the Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument that can analyze the elemental composition of rocks and soil from a distance. In very simple terms, the instrument shoots a laser at a rock, and the light emitted by the rock is then captured by spectrometers as a spectrum, which can be used to determine the composition of the rock. This requires the development of machine learning models to analyze the data, which is the focus of this presentation. Specifically, this type of problem is a supervised learning, multivariate regression problem. It is supervised because we have labeled data, and it is multivariate because we are predicting multiple outputs. NASA has made most of the ChemCam calibration data publicly available, and they have also published a few papers on the machine learning models they have developed for ChemCam. We have worked with one of the authors of these papers, Jens Frydenvang, who asserted that the current model is far from perfect and that there is room for improvement. Following this, we have decided to replicate and identify limitations in their work, which is the focus of our pre-thesis project."

When a new spectrum is collected on Mars, it is first preprocessed into the CCS format and then fed into the MOC model to predict the composition of the sample. Christian will elaborate on how exactly the MOC model works later in the presentation.\nOur goal was to replicate the MOC model and perform experiments to identify the components that contribute the most to the overall error \\(E(M)\\), as defined by the root mean squared error (RMSE).\nWe do this through a series of experiments, which Ivik will explain in more detail later in the presentation.\nBy doing this, we hope to gain a better understanding of the MOC model and to identify areas where it can be improved. Later on in the presentation, we will present our findings and talk about our plans for the thesis project next semester."

(2022) found GBR performed well for SuperCam calibration data.\n\n\n\nI will briefly summarize the key aspects of our related work section from our report.\nFirst, Takahashi and Thornton (2017) applied artificial neural networks (ANNs) to LIBS data and found that ANNs showed potential since they are able to learn the non-linear relationship between the LIBS spectra and the composition of the sample. This has inspired one of our experiments, as we compared the performance the MOC model with an ANN model.\nLepore, Ytsma, and Dyar (2022) examined how dividing LIBS spectra into sub-models impacts the prediction of major element compositions. Their findings suggest that using the entire spectrum instead of sub-models often reduces the error and enhances geochemical accuracy. This is interesting considering that sub-models were introduced to the MOC model to improve its performance, which contradicts the findings of this paper.\nBai et al. (2023) explored elastic net regression for Mars LIBS data and found it quite efficient, however perhaps more interestingly, they found that the Norm 3 normalization technique was the optimal normalization technique for their context. This is one of the two normalization techniques used to preprocess the CCS data, and this find is something we considered when performing our experiments.\nDyar and Ytsma (2021) found that accuracy in geochemical quantification with LIBS improves as the training set size increases. This is expected and tells us that we should aim to use as much data as possible when training our models.\nCastorena et al. (2021) developed a real-time, efficient deep spectral CNN for LIBS. While we did not have time to experiment with CNNs this semester, this is something we might consider in the future.\nFinally, Chen and Guestrin (2016) presented XGBoost, which is a gradient boosting system that has become popular among data scientists for its performance in diverse machine learning applications. Interestingly, Anderson et al. (2022) found that Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) performed well in predicting major oxides for SuperCam, which is ChemCam’s successor. This is why we chose to include XGBoost in our experiments, as it is a popular and effective implementation of GBR."

First, we have the calibration dataset, which consists of 408 pressed powder samples. Each sample was shot at 5 different locations, and 50 shots were taken at each location. The emitted light for each shot is then captured by 3 different spectrometers, each designed to analyze specific portions of the light spectrum.\nThe data is grouped into folders where each folder corresponds to a sample. Each folder contains a .csv file for each location, and each .csv file contains the spectra for the 3 spectrometers. This is what we refer to as the CCS data.\nAn example of a spectrum is shown in the figure on the right. The x-axis represents the wavelength, and the y-axis represents the intensity of the light at each wavelength. As you can see, there are some regions of the spectrum that are masked out. This masking is part of the preprocessing of the CCS data, which is something we will talk more about later in the presentation."

For each sample in the calibration dataset, we know the composition weight percentage of each of these oxides. This data is used to train the MOC model.\nThis table here shows an excerpt of the composition data for a few samples. You can see that we know the composition of each sample in terms of the weight percentage of each of the major oxides. The last column is the total weight percentage of the oxides, which should in theory sum to 100%. However, as you can see, the total percentages might not always add up to exactly 100%, occasionally even exceeding it. This discrepancy arises from two main factors.\nFirstly, the samples often contain additional elements beyond the major oxides we focus on, which can result in a total below 100%. Secondly, the inherent uncertainties in experimental measurements can cause the sum to vary, causing the total to etiher fall below or exceed 100%."

We have attempted to replicate this pipeline as faithfully as we could, but have had to make some design choices that differ from the original — mostly due to a lack of information regarding some aspects of the original design.  It’s important to keep in mind that this pipeline is for multivariate regression. That means we create predictions for each of 8 major oxides. However, most of the steps actually involve data being processed for each oxide individually. For both ICA and PLS, you can imagine that after some preprocessing steps, we branch out into 8 branches, each of which predict its own values for its associated oxide. And in the end, we put the outputs together to produce the MOC prediction.  I start by walking through the PLS-SM side, and then the ICA side."

First: they chose PLS because it can handle noisy data with far more variables than observations, and with significant correlation between variables. It’s also readily intrepretable by plotting the regression coefficients as a function of the spectral channels. This shows which wavelength ranges show correlations with the prediction composition."

So why submodels?  Different parts of the LIBS spectrum react differently to varying amounts of elements in the sample. So, a spectrum from a sample with a medium amount of an element might show patterns that aren’t there when there’s a very high or low amount of that element. This can be because when there’s too much of an element, it can overshadow its own signal, and the presence of other elements can also change the response.  Using sub-models lets them focus on specific concentration ranges for more accurate readings.  It’s hard for a single regression model to account for these variations. It often makes a tradeoff where it has good general performance, but performance worse on some samples. And specialist models (trained on a restricted range) will do good for that range, but much worse outside the range than a model trained on the full set.  So the solution was to combine several regression models trained on subsets of the full compositional range to improve overall performance across the full range, which overcomes the limitations of a single model, and then combine the results via blending.  In this case, they created 3 overlapping submodels for most of the major oxides (low, mid, high), and a full model training on the full compositional range."

They would occur because the samples in each sub-model with the most “extreme” compositions aren’t necessarily weighted as strongly when the model is trained, so may be less accurately predicted.

The first set of experiments were centered around outlier removal. In the initial stages of our implementation we realized that we would not be able to do outlier detection in the same way that Clegg et. al did it. Both in terms of the PLS side of the pipeline and also in the ICA side of the pipeline. Therefore we thought it would be interesting to conduct experiments that tested different aspects of our outlier removal process.\n(1) Automated outlier removal  The first experiment that we decided to conduct was to evaluate the effects of not doing outlier removal vs. our automated outlier removal for PLS-SM. The outcome of this experiment would provide us answers to two things. The first being an evaluation of our automated outlier removal. The second being an evaluation of the PLS model’s intrinsic ability to handle outliers.\nTable 1  As you can see from the table, our outlier removal had almost no effect on the RMSE. This result was surprising to us. We did not necessarily have any expectation that our outlier removal would perform better than clegg et. al’s, however, we would have expected to see more of an effect since we were removing quite a few outliers that theoretically should have a high, negative impact on the model’s predictions.\nThe interesting result, though, is the fact that PLS performed very well without our outlier removal and in fact comparable to clegg’s results, who manually picked out outliers. This result indicates that our outlier removal is not particularly effective in terms of improving RMSE, but also that PLS is seemingly a robust method in itself. Given the fact that we did not see much improvement, and the fact that we do not have the expertise to do manual outlier removal, it would have been beneficial to have investigated other methods such as clustering-based outlier detection rather than statistical approaches like we have used."

We did this to ensure that we were not being too aggressive in our outlier removal process, since this approach would result in fewer points overall being removed.\nTable 2  As can be seen in the table, this approach did not provide any improvements to the RMSE, either. Perhaps a more specialized outlier approach would yield greater performance of the PLS model. However, given that our results with both types of outlier removal are close to the results of Clegg et. al’s we have some evidence, although not conclusive, that the outlier removal component of the PLS phase is not a component that would provide many improvements to the overall RMSE. But as stated before, this may be different with different methods of outlier removal."

As we mentioned in the report we were unsure where in the ICA phase they had implemented it. Therefore we chose to experiment with different placements until we found a version which we thought was most appropiate. This experiment allowed us to do a with/without outlier removal test, similar to the PLS, which tests the intrinsic robustness of the ICA model.\nTable 3  Looking at the results then, we see that using MAD did in fact have a pretty significant effect on the results of ICA. This told us that ICA seems quite susceptible to outliers. Additionally, since ICA is worse across all oxides compared to PLS we wonder what the benefit of ICA in this context. A recent paper related to supercam model selection seems to agree with this observation since NASA chose to exclude it in their recent model."

In the report we mentioned being unsure how they utilized all 5 datasets for a sample in the ICA phase. Based on our understanding from the papers and through discussions with our external supervisor Jens, we identified two candidate methods of approaching this. The first being running ICA on each of the 5 datasets per sample and training the regression model on the results and the second being aggregating the 5 dataset into a single, average dataset as they do in PLS-SM. We chose the simpler second option, as we believed that averaging could help ICA more easily identify principal components, since we noticed that ICA seemed sensitive to outliers.\nTable 4.1 As can be seen in the first table the results are fairly similar across all oxides, except for Silicon where the results are worse. These variations in the results across the oxides did partly confirm our suspicion, in that for some oxides the results improved which indicates that it was easier for ICA to separate out signals for those oxides. However, as the results show it may also have had the opposite effect for some oxides. One possible interpretation of this is that noise in some areas might have been increased, making it harder to separate the signals properly. This is likely due to the smoothing effect of avereging which may have made some signals less distinct and therefore harder to identify.\nTable 4.2 The previous results then led us to wonder how much of an effect outlier detection would have with this aggregated dataset. We reasoned that noise would be amplified by this process and that it therefore would be easier to detect outliers. Surprisingly, there seemed to be some merit to this as there were quite a few improvements. In fact, for 5 out of 8 oxides we saw better results than clegg. This highligts two key points: First, the effectiveness of ICA seems depend on a robust outlier removal strategy, particularly with LIBS data. Second, the success of ICA seems to rely on the structure of the data. This would mean spending more effort on creating calibration data which is suitable for ICA. However, given the substantial time and resources required to generate such calibration data, the benefits of using ICA appear limited."

The decision to use these specifically was the fact they represented two fairly different approaches that both have the ability to learn complex patterns in data. Given the time constraint that we had, we felt that it would be sufficient to demonstrate whether the current MOC model could potentially be updated to include other models or perhaps that entirely different approaches to oxide predictions in LIBS data should be persued.\nTable 5 As you can see from the table XGBoost performed better in most cases and for some oxides even showed an improvement from the MOC model. Additionally, the ANN model also showed to be better than the MOC model in many cases.

For PLS-SM there seems to be neglible gains from outlier removal, while ICA benefits more from it. Generally, however, we determine that a “one size fits all” approach to outlier detection does not provide many benefits and perhaps different approaches needs to be developed. Such approaches could either involve entirely new algorithms or specialized approaches that account for the structure of data that mimics what an expert could do manually.\nData preprocessing\nRethinking While the current setup with PLS and ICA allows for interpretability e.g. regression plots and independent components, the MOC model as a whole loses the benefit of that because of the complexity of the pipeline. This is because you are interleaving to different models that are operating in distinct ways and adjusting everything from data preprocessing to outlier removal introduces complexity with diminishing returns."

We did not have the opportunity to spend nearly as much time as we would have liked to go into depth about the “why’s” of the results we saw.\nFor example, in the experiment with the aggregated datasets for ICA we saw mixed results across the different oxides. In some cases the RMSE improved, in others it did not. It would have been great to look more closely into the mechanisms that caused ICA to produce such results so that we could learn something from that. A second example is that we would have liked to have spent more time investigating the aspects of ANN and XGBoost that makes them so good for LIBS data. Understanding the specific components or mechanisms that make them produce such good results would have been tremendously useful and interesting."

This idea stems from our own results from XGBoost and ANN’s, which showed to be able to handle the complexities of the LIBS data very well. Exploring ensemble techniques such as Random forest or gradient boosting as well as machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks might offer advancements in the analysis of LIBS data. This notion is supported by papers such as supercam related paper that Patrick mentioned in the beginning.\nThe second avenue that could be explored is in the outlier detection domain. As I mentioned earlier, there might be benefits from exploring different or more advanced outlier detection methods. Exploring this avenue, potentially in conjunction with other prediction models, may yield results that could be beneficial for both existing Mars missions but also future ones.\nThe last suggestion that we give is to explore techniques that are based on dimensionality reduction such as PCA and Autoencoders to further simplify and improve the analysis. As you know, LIBS data is considered not only to be complex but also high dimensionality. This is why PLS and ICA are viable algorithms to consider in this context. This is because they are designed to reduce the dimensionality of the data without sacrificing the integrity of the data. Investigating new dimensionaly reduction techniques that could integrate with models that do not inherently do this, may yield interesting results as you may be able to leverage the strength of models that would otherwise not fit in the LIBS context."

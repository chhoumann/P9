**Experiments introduction**
<br>
Once the replication process was done we had to decide on a set of experiments that would best answer our problem definition.
<br>
A tricky aspects of answering the problem definition is defining what constitutes a component and in turn, how to define an experiment that would allow us to determine its contribution to the over all error.
<br>
On top of this, was the looming time constraint for delivery on the project. This meant that we had to be selective on the type of experiments that we chose.
We had to ensure that the experiments were impactful enough to be able to determine something about the pipeline.

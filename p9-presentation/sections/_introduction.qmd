::: {.notes}
In the 1970s, the Viking missions were the first to land on Mars.
Goal: Is there life on Mars?

Experiments showed positive results, but the results were inconclusive and were not repeated due to budget constraints.

1990s: Philosophical shift within NASA: "Is there life on Mars?" to "Did Mars ever have the conditions to support life as we know it?"
In 2004, the Mars Exploration Rover mission landed the rovers Spirit and Opportunity on Mars, which quickly discovered evidence of water on Mars.

A few years later in 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission landed the Curiosity rover on Mars.
Rover is equipped with a suite of instruments to study the Martian climate and geology and to search for organic material.

One of the instruments is the Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument that can analyze the elemental composition of rocks and soil from a distance.
ChemCam is used to study the composition of the Martian surface and to search for organic material.
This requires the development of machine learning models to analyze the data, which is the focus of this presentation.

NASA has made most of the ChemCam calibration data publicly available, and they have also published a few papers on the machine learning models they have developed for ChemCam.
We have worked with one of the authors of these papers, Jens Frydenvang, who asserted that the models are far from perfect and that there is room for improvement.
Following this, we have decided to replicate and improve upon their work.

The model currently used by the ChemCam team is the Multivariate Oxide Composition (MOC) model, illustrated in the figure on the right.
The MOC model is trained on a calibration dataset of clean, calibrated spectra (CCS), which I will give an overview of in a moment.
When a new spectrum is collected on Mars, it is first preprocessed into the CCS format and then fed into the MOC model to predict the composition of the sample.
Christian will elaborate on how exactly the MOC model works later in the presentation.

Our goal is to replicate the MOC model and perform experiments to identify the components that contribute the most to the overall error $E(M)$, as defined by the root mean squared error (RMSE).
We do this through a series of experiments, which Ivik will explain in more detail later in the presentation.
By doing this, we hope to gain a better understanding of the MOC model and to identify areas where it can be improved.

This is the focus of our pre-thesis project, and we will present our findings in this presentation and talk about our plans for the thesis project next semester.

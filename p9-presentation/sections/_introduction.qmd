::: {.notes}
In the 1970s, the Viking missions were the first to land on Mars.
Goal: Is there life on Mars?

Experiments showed positive results, but the results were inconclusive and were not repeated due to budget constraints.

1990s: Philosophical shift within NASA: "Is there life on Mars?" to "Did Mars ever have the conditions to support life as we know it?"
In 2004, the Mars Exploration Rover mission landed the rovers Spirit and Opportunity on Mars, which quickly discovered evidence of water on Mars.

A few years later in 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission landed the Curiosity rover on Mars.
Rover is equipped with a suite of instruments to study the Martian climate and geology and to search for organic material.

One of the instruments is the Chemistry and Camera (ChemCam) instrument, a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument that can analyze the elemental composition of rocks and soil from a distance.
ChemCam is used to study the composition of the Martian surface and to search for organic material.
This requires the development of machine learning models to analyze the data, which is the focus of this presentation.

NASA has made most of the ChemCam calibration data publicly available, and they have also published a few papers on the machine learning models they have developed for ChemCam.
Our goal is to replicate and improve upon their work.

## Problem Definition {.smaller}
*"In this work, we aim to solve the problem of identifying issues within the components of the current Multivariate Oxide Composition (MOC) model that limit its predictive accuracy and robustness. Following this, we will propose improvements to the model’s components that addresses these issues, thereby enhancing its overall accuracy and robustness."*

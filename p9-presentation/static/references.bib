  abstract     = {This work proposes a spectral convolutional neural network (CNN) operating on laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) signals to learn to (1) disentangle spectral signals from the sources of sensor uncertainty (i.e., pre-process) and (2) get qualitative and quantitative measures of chemical content of a sample given a spectral signal (i.e., calibrate). Once the spectral {CNN} is trained, it can accomplish either task through a single feedforward pass, with real-time benefits and without any additional side information requirements including dark current, system response, temperature and detector-to-target range. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches used by the Mars Science Lab for pre-processing and calibration for remote sensing observations from the Mars rover, 'Curiosity'.},

  abstract     = {Multiple sets of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) instruments, including {ChemCam} (Curiosity), {SuperCam} (Perseverance), and the Mars Surface Composition Detector ({MarSCoDe}, Zhurong), are working currently on the surface of Mars, a booming scene of {LIBS} technology application to planetary exploration. One of the primary challenges faced by those {LIBS} instruments is accurate and quantitative chemical composition determination of unexplored geological targets. Elastic net is a linear regression model that combines ridge regression and lasso model, which inherits the sparseness of lasso and the stability of ridge. In this work, we investigated the spectral features selected by elastic net model, the model performance and application to over 23,000 {LIBS} points. Selected features exhibit significant emission lines that are attributed to a certain single element and a few lines attributed to other related elements. These features enhance the interpretability of the model and weaken the matrix effect in {LIBS} quantitative analysis. In comparison, the results of elastic net are comparable and may be slightly better in some cases than other common linear regression models. For igneous calibration targets (norite, picrite, and shergottite), the predictions of elastic net are closer to the values measured in Earth laboratory than the final multivariate oxide composition values predicted by {ChemCam} team. Finally, we predicted the oxide abundances of 8 major elements from Mars {LIBS} spectra of over 23,000 points using elastic net. The predicted values of the elastic net models are highly correlated with those from the {ChemCam} team model. These results indicate that elastic net is viable for quantitative analysis Mars {LIBS} spectra. We propose that elastic net is an important candidate model for the quantitative analysis of the Zhurong Mar {SCoDe} {LIBS} spectra.},

  abstract     = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) data acquired from 2959 geochemical standards allow the effects of training set size on {LIBS} accuracy in geochemical analyses to be evaluated. In addition, {LIBS} prediction accuracies are quantified for 65 elements based on a typical benchtop instrument. Analyses used two equivalent randomly selected subsets of the full data set to compare prediction accuracies of partial least squares models using 75, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5, 1, and 0.5\% of the total data set for training and the remainder for testing. The number of components, a measure of complexity, in the {PLS} models was shown to increase with the size of the training set. Based on root mean square errors on unseen test data, our results show that the larger the training set, the better (lower) the prediction accuracy will be on unseen data. Calibration (training set) size was shown to have a first-order effect on prediction accuracy relative to spectral resolution and detector sensitivity. Different methods of assessing model accuracy using root mean square error ({RMSE}) are compared, including the error of the calibration ({RMSE}-C), the error of cross-validation ({RMSE}-{CV}), and the error of prediction ({RMSE}-P). Use of {RMSE}-C is inappropriate because the samples being predicted are those on which the model was trained. In data sets that are sufficiently large, use of test data ({RMSE}-P) provides the best measure of prediction accuracy, while {RMSE}-{CV} is useful only to provide an estimate of subsequent model performance. Increasing the number of crossvalidation folds for our large dataset yields surprisingly comparable {RMSE}-{CV} values for models with five or more (up to 100) folds, but this result is likely not applicable to smaller data sets and needs further evaluation.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) methods for analyzing geological samples is improved when calibration standards and unknown targets are compositionally similar. A recent study suggests that customized submodels can be used to optimize calibration datasets to achieve more accurate predictions [1]. In practice, this is difficult to implement because the errors inherent in the methods used for sorting unknown targets by composition may affect how successfully this matching can occur. Moreover, creation of submodels intrinsically reduces the size of the dataset on which the model is trained, which has been shown to reduce prediction accuracy. This paper uses {LIBS} spectra of 2990 unique rock powder standards to compare the accuracy of 1) submodels generated for each element over its geochemical range, 2) submodels created using {SiO}2 content only, 3) submodels created using the ratio of Si({II})/Si(I) emission lines to group spectra by a proxy for approximate plasma temperature, and 4) models created using all data. Results indicate that prediction accuracies are not always improved by creating submodels because subdividing a dataset to optimize calibrations will always result in a smaller database available for each submodel, and the reduced training set size negatively affects accuracy. Customized {LIBS} standards for specific applications might overcome this problem in cases where the matrix is similar and the expected concentration range is known. But in a majority of geochemical applications, submodel approaches are only useful in improving prediction accuracies when the initial database is itself extensive enough to support large, robust submodel calibration suites.},

  abstract     = {This paper reviews methods to compensate for matrix effects and self-absorption during quantitative analysis of compositions of solids measured using Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy ({LIBS}) and their applications to in-situ analysis. Methods to reduce matrix and self-absorption effects on calibration curves are first introduced. The conditions where calibration curves are applicable to quantification of compositions of solid samples and their limitations are discussed. While calibration-free {LIBS} ({CF}-{LIBS}), which corrects matrix effects theoretically based on the Boltzmann distribution law and Saha equation, has been applied in a number of studies, requirements need to be satisfied for the calculation of chemical compositions to be valid. Also, peaks of all elements contained in the target need to be detected, which is a bottleneck for in-situ analysis of unknown materials. Multivariate analysis techniques are gaining momentum in {LIBS} analysis. Among the available techniques, principal component regression ({PCR}) analysis and partial least squares ({PLS}) regression analysis, which can extract related information to compositions from all spectral data, are widely established methods and have been applied to various fields including in-situ applications in air and for planetary explorations. Artificial neural networks ({ANNs}), where non-linear effects can be modelled, have also been investigated as a quantitative method and their applications are introduced. The ability to make quantitative estimates based on {LIBS} signals is seen as a key element for the technique to gain wider acceptance as an analytical method, especially in in-situ applications. In order to accelerate this process, it is recommended that the accuracy should be described using common figures of merit which express the overall normalised accuracy, such as the normalised root mean square errors ({NRMSEs}), when comparing the accuracy obtained from different setups and analytical methods.},

  abstract     = {The SuperCam instrument on the Perseverance Mars 2020 rover uses a pulsed 1064~nm laser to ablate targets at a distance and conduct laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) by analyzing the light from the resulting plasma. SuperCam LIBS spectra are preprocessed to remove ambient light, noise, and the continuum signal present in LIBS observations. Prior to quantification, spectra are masked to remove noisier spectrometer regions and spectra are normalized to minimize signal fluctuations and effects of target distance. In some cases, the spectra are also standardized or binned prior to quantification. To determine quantitative elemental compositions of diverse geologic materials at Jezero crater, Mars, we use a suite of 1198 laboratory spectra of 334 well-characterized reference samples. The samples were selected to span a wide range of compositions and include typical silicate rocks, pure minerals (e.g., silicates, sulfates, carbonates, oxides), more unusual compositions (e.g., Mn ore and sodalite), and replicates of the sintered SuperCam calibration targets (SCCTs) onboard the rover. For each major element (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O), the database was subdivided into five “folds” with similar distributions of the element of interest. One fold was held out as an independent test set, and the remaining four folds were used to optimize multivariate regression models relating the spectrum to the composition. We considered a variety of models, and selected several for further investigation for each element, based primarily on the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) on the test set, when analyzed at 3~m. In cases with several models of comparable performance at 3~m, we incorporated the SCCT performance at different distances to choose the preferred model. Shortly after landing on Mars and collecting initial spectra of geologic targets, we selected one model per element. Subsequently, with additional data from geologic targets, some models were revised to ensure results that are more consistent with geochemical constraints. The calibration discussed here is a snapshot of an ongoing effort to deliver the most accurate chemical compositions with SuperCam LIBS.},

\section{Introduction}
% MSL: What is the mission? Why?
In November 2011, NASA launched the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, which landed the Curiosity rover on Mars in August 2012 inside Gale Crater. Its purpose is to investigate the Martian climate and geology, as well as the potential for life on Mars.
Early in the mission, Curiosity found chemical and mineral evidence that Mars once had the conditions necessary to support life.\cite{chemcam_nasa_website}

The rover itself is about the size of a car.
It has various instruments and cameras, including a laser instrument called ChemCam (Chemistry and Camera), which is used to analyze the chemical composition of rocks and soil on Mars.
The primary interest are rocks that either formed in water or show indications of organic materials.\cite{chemcam_nasa_website}

% ChemCam: How does it contribute to the mission? How?
ChemCam is a remote-sensing laser instrument developed by NASA in collaboration with the French national space agency (CNES).
The instrument is used to gather Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) data from geological samples on Mars. The data itself consists of a series of spectral readings, each forming a spectrum. These spectra represent the emitted light from a plasma created when the laser interacts with the target sample. Captured over a range of wavelengths, each spectrum is composed of various emission lines. Each emission line is associated with a specific element, and its intensity reflects the concentration of that element in the sample. Consequently, the collection of spectra serves as a complex, multi-dimensional fingerprint of the elemental composition of the examined geological formations.
This data is then used to determine the elemental composition of these samples.\cite{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017}

% These are computationally challenging problems because...
% Multicollinearity: In computational terms, multicollinearity represents a challenge for feature selection and model interpretability. Traditional regression algorithms struggle when variables (features) are highly correlated because they cannot easily isolate the contribution of each variable to the prediction (output). This hampers the model's ability to generalize well to new data and makes it difficult to understand which features are most important for the prediction task. Advanced techniques like ridge regression or feature extraction methods may be required to handle this.
% 
% Matrix Effects: These constitute a challenge in data preprocessing and normalization. In machine learning terms, matrix effects introduce a form of 'class imbalance' or 'data skew.' The model can be misled by the dominant features (in this case, spectral lines influenced by matrix effects) and fail to generalize well. Dealing with this requires sophisticated preprocessing techniques or specialized algorithms capable of handling imbalanced or skewed data.

However, the interpretation of LIBS data poses significant computational challenges.
First, a high degree of multicollinearity exists within the spectral data, rendering traditional linear analysis methods less effective.
The multicollinearity arises due to the correlation among different spectral channels, influenced both by the multi-line emission characteristics of individual elements and by geochemical correlations between elements.\cite{andersonImprovedAccuracyQuantitative2017}

Secondly, the complexity of LIBS spectra is increased by multiple interacting physical processes.
These interactions, collectively referred to as 'matrix effects,' introduce variability into the emission line intensities independent of the elements' concentrations.
Such variability complicates the direct interpretation of the spectra and poses challenges for computational models aiming for accurate elemental quantification.\cite{andersonImprovedAccuracyQuantitative2017}

The ChemCam team uses a model called the Multivariate Oxide Composition (MOC) model to predict the composition of major oxides in geological samples. As part of their preprocessing, they use various techniques to remove noise and outliers from the data.\cite{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017}

% -> This leads us to the predictioin of composition of major oxides
% There exists a model for this, but it has some limitations
The MOC model itself uses a series of submodels, each of which predicts the concentration of a single oxide. It combines the output of these with regression models based on ICA scores to predict the composition of major oxides in geological samples.
The model is trained on a calibration dataset consisting of LIBS data from 408 terrestrial rock samples, which were created in a laboratory to simulate the conditions of the Martian surface.\cite{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017}

% We narrow down to limitations that in any way inhibit the precision & accuracy of the model
% // _Any_ improvements to the model will be beneficial to the mission
% We want to investigate these limitations and propose improvements
Improving the predictions of the chemical compositions of LIBS data has the potential to advancing the Mars Science Laboratory's scientific objectives.
Enhanced accuracy in elemental quantification can give us more detailed information about Mars' geology and habitability, thereby amplifying the mission's overall scientific yield. 

Consequently, there is a need to not only identify and examine the existing model's limitations but also to understand precisely why improvements would be beneficial and how they can be effectively implemented.

As such, we aim to identify potential limitations and areas of improvement in the Multivariate Oxide Composition model's predictive accuracy and robustness in predicting the composition of major oxides in Martian geological samples using Earth-based calibration data.

% The MOC model, as it stands, may not provide optimal accuracy in predicting the composition of major oxides.
% Furthermore, its robustness—its consistent performance across diverse data scenarios, especially in the presence of noise or outliers—might be questionable.

% The Mars Science Laboratory  mission, through the Curiosity rover and its ChemCam instrument, relies heavily on the Multivariate Oxide Composition model to determine the elemental composition of Martian geological samples. Given the mission's pivotal aim to investigate Martian geology and the potential for life on Mars, the precision and robustness of this model are paramount. However, the current MOC model, trained on Earth-based rock samples, may not achieve optimal accuracy in predicting the composition of major oxides on Mars. Furthermore, its resilience to consistently perform across varied data scenarios, particularly in the face of spectral interference, remains uncertain.

% This raises a critical question: How can the MOC model be refined to enhance its accuracy and robustness, ensuring more reliable predictions that can better support the objectives of the MSL mission?

\section{Definition}
Let $D$ be the LIBS data set, defined in the space $\Lambda \times \mathbb{R}^m$, where $\Lambda$ represents the set of possible wavelengths and $\mathbb{R}^m$ denotes the $m$-dimensional space of intensities.
The dataset $D$ is given by:

\begin{equation}
    D = \{ (\lambda_1, \vec{I}_1), (\lambda_2, \vec{I}_2), \ldots, (\lambda_n, \vec{I}_n) \}
\end{equation}

Each element $(\lambda_i, \vec{I}_i) \in \Lambda \times \mathbb{R}^{m}$ comprises the wavelength $\lambda_i$ of the $i^{th}$ measurement point, measured in nanometers, and an $m$-dimensional intensity vector $\vec{I}_i = [I_{i1}, I_{i2}, \ldots, I_{im}]$.
This vector captures the intensity values at $\lambda_i$ for each of the $m$ shots, measured in units of photons per channel.

Given a set of major oxides $E$ where $k=|E|$, define a model $M$ that learns a hypothesis function $f: \Lambda \times \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$ to predict the composition of the $k$ major oxides in geological samples.
The output of the hypothesis function is a vector $\mathbf{\hat{y}} = [o_{1}, o_{2}, \ldots, o_{8}]$ where $o_{i}$ is the predicted value of the weight percentage of the $i^{th}$ major oxide.

We define a function $g$ that measures the difference between the predicted weight percentages $\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ and the true weight percentages $\mathbf{y}$.
$$
g: \mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{R}^k \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{+}
$$
where $g(\mathbf{\hat{y}}, \mathbf{y})$ can be any metric that measures the difference between the two vectors. This function is used to evaluate the performance of the model.

\section{Background}
% Background / Preliminaries (what you need to know in order to understand the story)

% What is the purpose of the MSL mission? What is the purpose of the ChemCam instrument?

The NASA ChemCam (Chemistry and Camera) is an advanced instrument developed by NASA in collaboration with the French national space agency (CNES).
It is a remote-sensing laser instrument designed to analyze the chemical composition of rocks and soil on Mars\cite{chemcam_nasa_website}.
The instrument is mounted on the Curiosity rover and is used to collect data in the Gale Crater on Mars\cite{curiosity_nasa_website}.
It leverages the ChemCam-LIBS model, which uses machine learning models to analyze the spectral data obtained from ChemCam.\cite{andersonImprovedAccuracyQuantitative2017}\cite{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017}

The use of LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) technology in planetary exploration has proven to be effective in analyzing soil and rock samples \cite{knight_characterization_2000}.

A laser pulses to ablate and remove any surface contaminants, such as dust and weathering layers, to expose the underlying material.
The laser generates a plasma plume from the now-exposed sample material.
This plasma plume emits light, which, when collected and analyzed, reveals the elemental composition of the sample by correlating the intensity of emitted light with specific wavelengths in a LIBS spectrum.
The LIBS technique enables remote analyses of materials without the need for sample preparation.
It allows for rapid analyses because of the immediate spectrum collection from the subsequent plasma, while maintaining a high spatial resolution due to its small observation footprints.
This high resolution is essential for pinpointing and investigating small features. \cite{wiens_chemcam_2012}

In 2013, \citeauthor{wiens_pre-flight_2013} published a paper describing the pre-flight calibration and initial data processing for the ChemCam LIBS instrument.
This paper introduces methods for preprocessing spectra samples and a regression model based on Partial Least Squares (PLS2) used to predict the composition of geological samples on Mars.
The model was trained on a dataset of 69 rock samples from Earth, which were created in a laboratory to simulate the conditions of the Martian surface.
This dataset is often referred to as the calibration dataset.

Two key conclusions were drawn from this paper:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A larger dataset is needed to improve the accuracy of the model.
    \item The PLS2 model is not ideal for this type of data, and an argument is made for using PLS1 instead because of its ability to optimize each element separately, which in can improve the accuracy although it suffers slower run times.
\end{enumerate}

Based on this work, \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017} published a paper in 2017 describing a new approach to the ChemCam LIBS calibration model.
This paper introduces a new model based on PLS1 with a sub-model approach (PLS-SM) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
In addition, a much larger calibration dataset was used, consisting of 408 samples.
Using this, the team was able to improve the predictions by employing a \textit{submodel} PLS approach in tandem with ICA.
This model is referred to as the Multivariate Oxide Composition (MOC) model.
The MOC model is currently used by the ChemCam team to analyze the LIBS data collected by the Curiosity rover.

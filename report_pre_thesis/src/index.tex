The whole story â€“ longer version but still short, also motivates

\section{Background}
% Background / Preliminaries (what you need to know in order to understand the story)

The NASA ChemCam (Chemistry and Camera) is an advanced instrument developed by NASA in collaboration with the French national space agency (CNES).
It is a remote-sensing laser instrument designed to analyze the chemical composition of rocks and soil on Mars\cite{chemcam_nasa_website}.
The instrument is mounted on the Curiosity rover and is used to collect data in the Gale Crater on Mars\cite{curiosity_nasa_website}.
It leverages the ChemCam-LIBS model, which uses machine learning models to analyze the spectral data obtained from ChemCam.\cite{andersonImprovedAccuracyQuantitative2017}\cite{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017}

The use of LIBS (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy) technology in planetary exploration has proven to be effective in analyzing soil and rock samples \cite{knight_characterization_2000}.

Initially, a laser is fired multiple times to ablate and remove any surface contaminants, such as dust and weathering layers, to expose the underlying material.
Afterwards, the laser generates a plasma plume from the now-exposed sample material.
This plasma plume emits light, which, when collected and analyzed, reveals the elemental composition of the sample by correlating the intensity of emitted light with specific wavelengths in a LIBS spectrum.
The LIBS technique enables remote analyses of materials without the need for sample preparation.
It allows for rapid analyses because of the immediate spectrum collection from the subsequent plasma, while maintaining a high spatial resolution due to its small observation footprints.
This high resolution is essential for pinpointing and investigating small features. \cite{wiens_chemcam_2012}

In 2013, \citeauthor{wiens_pre-flight_2013} published a paper describing the pre-flight calibration and initial data processing for the ChemCam LIBS instrument.
This paper introduces methods for preprocessing spectra samples and a regression model based on Partial Least Squares (PLS2) used to predict the composition of geological samples on Mars.

% Introduce the problem - what are they actually trying to do with ChemCam, the LIBS data and their ML models?
    % Describe how ChemCam is just a part of the whole rover with a dedicated team
    % Describe how our interest/field is only a part of the ChemCam process (because instrument calibration is not part of the CS domain)
% Talk about the original pre-flight calibration paper (2013)
% Discuss the conclusions of this paper (the need for a larger dataset as well as a different approach that does not use PLS2)
% Talk about the 2017 paper (the new approach that uses PLS1 and ICA) and how it improves on the previous model
% Discuss where we are today (MOC).

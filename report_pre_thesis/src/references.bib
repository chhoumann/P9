  abstract     = {Accurate quantitative analysis of diverse geologic materials is one of the primary challenges faced by the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)-based ChemCam instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. The SuperCam instrument on the Mars 2020 rover, as well as other LIBS instruments developed for geochemical analysis on Earth or other planets, will face the same challenge. Consequently, part of the ChemCam science team has focused on the development of improved multivariate analysis calibrations methods. Developing a single regression model capable of accurately determining the composition of very different target materials is difficult because the response of an element's emission lines in LIBS spectra can vary with the concentration of other elements. We demonstrate a conceptually simple “sub-model” method for improving the accuracy of quantitative LIBS analysis of diverse target materials. The method is based on training several regression models on sets of targets with limited composition ranges and then “blending” these “sub-models” into a single final result. Tests of the sub-model method show improvement in test set root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for almost all cases. The sub-model method, using partial least squares (PLS) regression, is being used as part of the current ChemCam quantitative calibration, but the sub-model method is applicable to any multivariate regression method and may yield similar improvements.},

  abstract     = {The ChemCam Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity has obtained {$>$}300,000 spectra of rock and soil analysis targets since landing at Gale Crater in 2012, and the spectra represent perhaps the largest publicly-available LIBS datasets. The compositions of the major elements, reported as oxides (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O), have been re-calibrated using a laboratory LIBS instrument, Mars-like atmospheric conditions, and a much larger set of standards (408) that span a wider compositional range than previously employed. The new calibration uses a combination of partial least squares (PLS1) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms, together with a calibration transfer matrix to minimize differences between the conditions under which the standards were analyzed in the laboratory and the conditions on Mars. While the previous model provided good results in the compositional range near the average Mars surface composition, the new model fits the extreme compositions far better. Examples are given for plagioclase feldspars, where silicon was significantly over-estimated by the previous model, and for calcium-sulfate veins, where silicon compositions near zero were inaccurate. The uncertainties of major element abundances are described as a function of the abundances, and are overall significantly lower than the previous model, enabling important new geochemical interpretations of the data.},

  abstract     = {The {ChemCam} instrument package on the Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, is the first planetary science instrument to employ laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) to determine the compositions of geological samples on another planet. Pre-processing of the spectra involves subtracting the ambient light background, removing noise, removing the electron continuum, calibrating for the wavelength, correcting for the variable distance to the target, and applying a wavelength-dependent correction for the instrument response. Further processing of the data uses multivariate and univariate comparisons with a {LIBS} spectral library developed prior to launch as well as comparisons with several on-board standards post-landing. The level-2 data products include semi-quantitative abundances derived from partial least squares regression. A {LIBS} spectral library was developed using 69 rock standards in the form of pressed powder disks, glasses, and ceramics to minimize heterogeneity on the scale of the observation (350–550μm dia.). The standards covered typical compositional ranges of igneous materials and also included sulfates, carbonates, and phyllosilicates. The provenance and elemental and mineralogical compositions of these standards are described. Spectral characteristics of this data set are presented, including the size distribution and integrated irradiances of the plasmas, and a proxy for plasma temperature as a function of distance from the instrument. Two laboratory-based clones of {ChemCam} reside in Los Alamos and Toulouse for the purpose of adding new spectra to the database as the need arises. Sensitivity to differences in wavelength correlation to spectral channels and spectral resolution has been investigated, indicating that spectral registration needs to be within half a pixel and resolution needs to match within 1.5 to 2.6pixels. Absolute errors are tabulated for derived compositions of each major element in each standard using {PLS} regression. Sources of errors are investigated and discussed, and methods for improving the analytical accuracy of compositions derived from {ChemCam} spectra are discussed.},

Overall, {ChemCam} supports {MSL} with five capabilities: remote classification of rock and soil characteristics; quantitative elemental compositions including light elements like hydrogen and some elements to which {LIBS} is uniquely sensitive (e.g., Li, Be, Rb, Sr, Ba); remote removal of surface dust and depth profiling through surface coatings; context imaging; and passive spectroscopy over the 240–905 nm range. {ChemCam} is built in two sections: The mast unit, consisting of a laser, telescope, {RMI}, and associated electronics, resides on the rover’s mast, and is described in a companion paper. {ChemCam}’s body unit, which is mounted in the body of the rover, comprises an optical demultiplexer, three spectrometers, detectors, their coolers, and associated electronics and data handling logic. Additional instrument components include a 6 m optical fiber which transfers the {LIBS} light from the telescope to the body unit, and a set of onboard calibration targets. {ChemCam} was integrated and tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory where it also underwent {LIBS} calibration with 69 geological standards prior to integration with the rover. Post-integration testing used coordinated mast and instrument commands, including {LIBS} line scans on rock targets during system-level thermal-vacuum tests. In this paper we describe the body unit, optical fiber, and calibration targets, and the assembly, testing, and verification of the instrument prior to launch.},

  abstract     = {Early in the next century, several space missions are planned with the goal of landing craft on asteroids, comets, the Moon, and Mars. To increase the scientific return of these missions, new methods are needed to provide (1) significantly more analyses per mission lifetime, and (2) expanded analytical capabilities. One method that has the potential to meet both of these needs for the elemental analysis of geological samples is laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}). These capabilities are possible because the laser plasma provides rapid analysis and the laser pulse can be focused on a remotely located sample to perform a stand-off measurement. Stand-off is defined as a distance up to 20 m between the target and laser. Here we present the results of a characterization of {LIBS} for the stand-off analysis of soils at reduced air pressures and in a simulated Martian atmosphere (5–7 torr pressure of {CO}
                  2
                  ) showing the feasibility of {LIBS} for space exploration. For example, it is demonstrated that an analytically useful laser plasma can be generated at distances up to 19 m by using only 35 {mJ}/pulse from a compact laser. Some characteristics of the laser plasma at reduced pressure were also investigated. Temporally and spectrally resolved imaging showed significant changes in the plasma as the pressure was reduced and also showed that the analyte signals and mass ablated from a target were strongly dependent on pressure. As the pressure decreased from 590 torr to the 40–100 torr range, the signals increased by a factor of about 3–4, and as the pressure was further reduced the signals decreased. This behavior can be explained by pressure-dependent changes in the mass of material vaporized and the frequency of collisions between species in the plasma. Changes in the temperature and the electron density of the plasmas with pressure were also examined and detection limits for selected elements were determined.},

One of the primary challenges faced by those {LIBS} instruments is accurate and quantitative chemical composition determination of unexplored geological targets. Elastic net is a linear regression model that combines ridge regression and lasso model, which inherits the sparseness of lasso and the stability of ridge. In this work, we investigated the spectral features selected by elastic net model, the model performance and application to over 23,000 {LIBS} points. Selected features exhibit significant emission lines that are attributed to a certain single element and a few lines attributed to other related elements. These features enhance the interpretability of the model and weaken the matrix effect in {LIBS} quantitative analysis. In comparison, the results of elastic net are comparable and may be slightly better in some cases than other common linear regression models. For igneous calibration targets (norite, picrite, and shergottite), the predictions of elastic net are closer to the values measured in Earth laboratory than the final multivariate oxide composition values predicted by {ChemCam} team. Finally, we predicted the oxide abundances of 8 major elements from Mars {LIBS} spectra of over 23,000 points using elastic net. The predicted values of the elastic net models are highly correlated with those from the {ChemCam} team model. These results indicate that elastic net is viable for quantitative analysis Mars {LIBS} spectra. We propose that elastic net is an important candidate model for the quantitative analysis of the Zhurong Mar {SCoDe} {LIBS} spectra.},

In addition, {LIBS} prediction accuracies are quantified for 65 elements based on a typical benchtop instrument. Analyses used two equivalent randomly selected subsets of the full data set to compare prediction accuracies of partial least squares models using 75, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5, 1, and 0.5\% of the total data set for training and the remainder for testing. The number of components, a measure of complexity, in the {PLS} models was shown to increase with the size of the training set. Based on root mean square errors on unseen test data, our results show that the larger the training set, the better (lower) the prediction accuracy will be on unseen data. Calibration (training set) size was shown to have a first-order effect on prediction accuracy relative to spectral resolution and detector sensitivity. Different methods of assessing model accuracy using root mean square error ({RMSE}) are compared, including the error of the calibration ({RMSE}-C), the error of cross-validation ({RMSE}-{CV}), and the error of prediction ({RMSE}-P). Use of {RMSE}-C is inappropriate because the samples being predicted are those on which the model was trained. In data sets that are sufficiently large, use of test data ({RMSE}-P) provides the best measure of prediction accuracy, while {RMSE}-{CV} is useful only to provide an estimate of subsequent model performance. Increasing the number of crossvalidation folds for our large dataset yields surprisingly comparable {RMSE}-{CV} values for models with five or more (up to 100) folds, but this result is likely not applicable to smaller data sets and needs further evaluation.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) methods for analyzing geological samples is improved when calibration standards and unknown targets are compositionally similar. A recent study suggests that customized submodels can be used to optimize calibration datasets to achieve more accurate predictions [1]. In practice, this is difficult to implement because the errors inherent in the methods used for sorting unknown targets by composition may affect how successfully this matching can occur. Moreover, creation of submodels intrinsically reduces the size of the dataset on which the model is trained, which has been shown to reduce prediction accuracy. This paper uses {LIBS} spectra of 2990 unique rock powder standards to compare the accuracy of 1) submodels generated for each element over its geochemical range, 2) submodels created using {SiO}2 content only, 3) submodels created using the ratio of Si({II})/Si(I) emission lines to group spectra by a proxy for approximate plasma temperature, and 4) models created using all data. Results indicate that prediction accuracies are not always improved by creating submodels because subdividing a dataset to optimize calibrations will always result in a smaller database available for each submodel, and the reduced training set size negatively affects accuracy. Customized {LIBS} standards for specific applications might overcome this problem in cases where the matrix is similar and the expected concentration range is known. But in a majority of geochemical applications, submodel approaches are only useful in improving prediction accuracies when the initial database is itself extensive enough to support large, robust submodel calibration suites.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews methods to compensate for matrix effects and self-absorption during quantitative analysis of compositions of solids measured using Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy ({LIBS}) and their applications to in-situ analysis. Methods to reduce matrix and self-absorption effects on calibration curves are first introduced. The conditions where calibration curves are applicable to quantification of compositions of solid samples and their limitations are discussed. While calibration-free {LIBS} ({CF}-{LIBS}), which corrects matrix effects theoretically based on the Boltzmann distribution law and Saha equation, has been applied in a number of studies, requirements need to be satisfied for the calculation of chemical compositions to be valid. Also, peaks of all elements contained in the target need to be detected, which is a bottleneck for in-situ analysis of unknown materials. Multivariate analysis techniques are gaining momentum in {LIBS} analysis. Among the available techniques, principal component regression ({PCR}) analysis and partial least squares ({PLS}) regression analysis, which can extract related information to compositions from all spectral data, are widely established methods and have been applied to various fields including in-situ applications in air and for planetary explorations. Artificial neural networks ({ANNs}), where non-linear effects can be modelled, have also been investigated as a quantitative method and their applications are introduced. The ability to make quantitative estimates based on {LIBS} signals is seen as a key element for the technique to gain wider acceptance as an analytical method, especially in in-situ applications. In order to accelerate this process, it is recommended that the accuracy should be described using common figures of merit which express the overall normalised accuracy, such as the normalised root mean square errors ({NRMSEs}), when comparing the accuracy obtained from different setups and analytical methods.},

  abstract = {The ChemCam instrument on board Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover uses the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique to remotely analyze Martian rocks. It retrieves spectra up to a distance of seven meters to quantify and to quantitatively analyze the sampled rocks. Like any field application, on-site measurements by LIBS are altered by diverse matrix effects which induce signal variations that are specific to the nature of the sample. Qualitative aspects remain to be studied, particularly LIBS sample identification to determine which samples are of interest for further analysis by ChemCam and other rover instruments. This can be performed with the help of different chemometric methods that model the spectra variance in order to identify a the rock from its spectrum. In this paper we test independent components analysis (ICA) rock classification by remote LIBS. We show that using measures of distance in ICA space, namely the Manhattan and the Mahalanobis distance, we can efficiently classify spectra of an unknown rock. The Mahalanobis distance gives overall better performances and is easier to manage than the Manhattan distance for which the determination of the cut-off distance is not easy. However these two techniques are complementary and their analytical performances will improve with time during MSL operations as the quantity of available Martian spectra will grow. The analysis accuracy and performances will benefit from a combination of the two approaches.},

	abstract = {Optical emission spectroscopy of laser-produced plasmas, commonly known as laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}), is an emerging analytical tool for rapid soil analysis. However, speciﬁc challenges with {LIBS} exist, such as matrix effects and quantiﬁcation issues, which require further study in the application of {LIBS}, particularly for the analysis of heterogeneous samples, such as soils. Advancements in the applications of machine learning ({ML}) methods can address some of these issues, advancing the potential for {LIBS} in soil analysis. This article aims to review the progress of {LIBS} application combined with {ML} methods, focusing on methodological approaches used in reducing matrix effect, feature selection, quantiﬁcation analysis, soil classiﬁcation, and self-absorption. The performance of various adopted {ML} approaches is discussed, including their shortcomings and advantages, to provide researchers with a clear picture of the current status of {ML} applications in {LIBS} for improving its analytical capability. The challenges and prospects of {LIBS} development in soil analysis are proposed, offering a path toward future research. This review article emphasizes {ML} tools for {LIBS} soil analysis, which are broadly relevant for other {LIBS} applications.},

Such datasets can be extremely noisy and often contain a significant amount of outliers that result from sensor malfunction or human operation faults. In order to utilize such data for real-world applications, it is critical to detect outliers so that models built from these datasets will not be skewed by outliers. In this paper, we propose a new outlier detection method that utilizes the correlations in the data (e.g., taxi trip distance vs. trip time). Different from existing outlier detection methods, we build a robust regression model that explicitly models the outliers and detects outliers simultaneously with the model fitting. We validate our approach on real-world datasets against methods specifically designed for each dataset as well as the state of the art outlier detectors. Our outlier detection method achieves better performances, demonstrating the robustness and generality of our method. Last, we report interesting case studies on some outliers that result from atypical events.},

	doi = {10.1039/C5JA00417A},
	abstract = {At Gale crater, {ChemCam} acquired its first laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) target on Sol 13 of the landed portion of the mission. Up to Sol 800, more than 188,000 {LIBS} spectra were acquired on more than 5,800 points distributed over 650 individual targets. We present a comprehensive review of {ChemCam} scientific accomplishments during that period, together with a focus on the lessons learned from the first use of {LIBS} in space. For data processing, we describe new tools that had to be developed to account for the uniqueness of Mars data. With regards to chemistry, we present a summary of the composition range measured on Mars for major-element oxides ({SiO}2, {TiO}2, Al2O3, {FeOT}, {MgO}, {CaO}, Na2O, K2O) based on various multivariate models, with associated precisions. {ChemCam} also observed H, the non-metallic elements C, O, P, and S, which are usually difficult to quantify with {LIBS}. F and Cl are observed through their molecular lines. We discuss the most relevant {LIBS} lines for detection of minor and trace elements (Li, Rb, Sr, Ba, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn). These results were obtained thanks to comprehensive ground reference datasets, which are set to mimic the expected mineralogy and chemistry on Mars. With regard to the first use of {LIBS} in space, we analyze and quantify, often for the first time, each of the advantages of using stand-off {LIBS} in space: no sample preparation, analysis within its petrological context, dust removal, sub-millimeter scale investigation, multi-point analysis, the ability to carry out statistical surveys and whole-rock analyses, and rapid data acquisition. We conclude with a discussion of {ChemCam} performance to survey the geochemistry of Mars, and its valuable support of decisions about selecting where and whether to make observations with more time and resource-intensive tools in the rover’s instrument suite. In the end, we presents a bird’s-eye view of the many scientific results: discovery of felsic Noachian crust, first observation of hydrated soil, discovery of manganese-rich coatings and fracture fills indicating strong oxidation potential in Mars’ early atmosphere, characterization of soils by grain size, and wide scale mapping of sedimentary strata, conglomerates, and diagenetic materials.},

  abstract = {The SuperCam instrument on the Perseverance Mars 2020 rover uses a pulsed 1064~nm laser to ablate targets at a distance and conduct laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) by analyzing the light from the resulting plasma. SuperCam LIBS spectra are preprocessed to remove ambient light, noise, and the continuum signal present in LIBS observations. Prior to quantification, spectra are masked to remove noisier spectrometer regions and spectra are normalized to minimize signal fluctuations and effects of target distance. In some cases, the spectra are also standardized or binned prior to quantification. To determine quantitative elemental compositions of diverse geologic materials at Jezero crater, Mars, we use a suite of 1198 laboratory spectra of 334 well-characterized reference samples. The samples were selected to span a wide range of compositions and include typical silicate rocks, pure minerals (e.g., silicates, sulfates, carbonates, oxides), more unusual compositions (e.g., Mn ore and sodalite), and replicates of the sintered SuperCam calibration targets (SCCTs) onboard the rover. For each major element (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O), the database was subdivided into five “folds” with similar distributions of the element of interest. One fold was held out as an independent test set, and the remaining four folds were used to optimize multivariate regression models relating the spectrum to the composition. We considered a variety of models, and selected several for further investigation for each element, based primarily on the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) on the test set, when analyzed at 3~m. In cases with several models of comparable performance at 3~m, we incorporated the SCCT performance at different distances to choose the preferred model. Shortly after landing on Mars and collecting initial spectra of geologic targets, we selected one model per element. Subsequently, with additional data from geologic targets, some models were revised to ensure results that are more consistent with geochemical constraints. The calibration discussed here is a snapshot of an ongoing effort to deliver the most accurate chemical compositions with SuperCam LIBS.},

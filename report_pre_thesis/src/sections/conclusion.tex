\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Our research aimed to identify limitations in ChemCam's method for quantifying Martian geological samples.
We replicated the ChemCam team's Multivariate Oxide Composition model, which is based on a combination of Partial Least Squares (PLS) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA).
Our findings revealed challenges in the way the current methodology handles the complexities of LIBS data, yet also demonstrated room for potential improvement.
Moving forward, integrating machine learning and expanding calibration datasets emerges as the next step to address the complexities of Martian geology effectively.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
Our research aimed to identify limitations in ChemCam's method for quantifying Martian geological samples.
We replicated the ChemCam team's Multivariate Oxide Composition model, which is based on a combination of PLS and ICA.
Our findings revealed challenges in the way the current methodology handles the complexities of LIBS data, yet also demonstrated potential paths for improvement.
Moving forward, integrating machine learning and expanding calibration datasets emerges as the next step to address the complexities of Martian geology effectively.

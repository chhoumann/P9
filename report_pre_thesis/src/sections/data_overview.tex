\section{Data Overview}\label{subsec:data_overview}

For each target, the data is split into five datasets, one for each location on the sample that was shot at by the laser.
Each dataset contains CCS data stored in a \texttt{.csv} file, which is read into a Pandas dataframe\cite{pandas} using the \texttt{read\_csv} function.
Because the CCS data includes several lines of header information, we skip these lines using the \texttt{skiprows} parameter.

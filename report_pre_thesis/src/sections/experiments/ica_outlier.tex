\subsection{Experiment: ICA MAD Outlier Removal}\label{sec:experiment_ica_mad_outlier_removal}
In the ICA phase, the original authors employed the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for outlier removal, yet the detailed methodology of their approach was not fully delineated.
Consequently, in our version of the pipeline, we chose to exclude the outlier removal step during the ICA phase to avoid introducing unsubstantiated assumptions, as described in Section~\ref{sec:ica_data_preprocessing}.
This decision allows us to evaluate the intrinsic effectiveness of the ICA phase without outlier removal and assesses the impact of introducing MAD (Median Absolute Deviation) for outlier removal in our pipeline replication. 
By comparing results with and without MAD, we aim to quantitatively determine its utility in reducing noise and improving data quality. 
This will also provide insights into the robustness of the ICA phase against outliers, offering a comprehensive understanding of the pipeline's capabilities and limitations.

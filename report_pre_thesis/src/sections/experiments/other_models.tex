\subsection{Experiment: Other Models}\label{sec:experiment_other_models}
\citet{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017} have only compared their new approach with the original method presented by \citet{wiensPreFlight3}, and have not conducted experiments using alternative methods to establish the superiority of their chosen approach.
Therefore, we decided to compare the performance of the PLS1-SM and ICA models to other models.
The objective is to evaluate two distinct scenarios.
In the first scenario, we aim to conduct a direct comparison between the MOC model and an alternative model. The second scenario revolves around substituting either PLS or ICA with a different model and then calculating a weighted average.
We have decided to conduct the experiments using the following models:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{XGBoost}, a gradient boosting algorithm, \cite{chen_xgboost_2016}.
	\item \textbf{ANN}, a neural network model, \cite{scikit-learn}.
\end{itemize}
% TODO: Argue why we chose these models (ref SuperCam paper).
% TODO: Add results and discussion.

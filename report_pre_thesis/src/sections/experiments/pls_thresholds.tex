\subsection{Experiment: PLS Fixed Thresholds}\label{sec:experiment_pls_fixed_thresholds}
Secondly, maintaining the threshold values from the second iteration of the outlier removal in the PLS1-SM training process would lead to a more conservative outlier removal process where fewer samples are removed.
The reason for doing so is that we do not know the basis for the original author's manual outlier removal process, and it is possible that they were more conservative than our automated process.
Consequently, a more conservative approach could potentially align our replica of the pipeline more closely with the original.

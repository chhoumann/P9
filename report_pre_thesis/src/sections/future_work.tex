\section{Recommendations for Future Work}\label{sec:recommendations_for_future_work}
Suggestions for potential improvements or modifications in the methodology.
Identification of any additional benchmarks that may be relevant for future studies.

% TODO: Mention the possibility of implementing MAD outlier detection in ICA (since the paper is unclear about how they did it, we could experiment with it and see if we could use it to improve the results)

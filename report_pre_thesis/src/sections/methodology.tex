\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}
% Method / Our Contribution (Detailed main part of the story, or how the analysis was done)
Since we did not have access to the original pipeline, we have recreated it at accurately as we could based on the available information in \citeauthor{andersonImprovedAccuracyQuantitative2017} and \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017}.
However, these papers did not include all the details of the pipeline, so we have had to make some assumptions and creative decisions ourselves.
In addition, some aspects of the pipeline rely on qualitative assessments made by the original authors --- something we cannot do because we are not domain experts.
Consequently, our pipeline is not identical to the original, but we have strived to make it as close as possible.

This section is dedicated to describing the methodology of our pipeline, how it differs from the original, and which design choices we have made and why.
Furthermore, we delve into the experiments we have conducted to evaluate the performance of our pipeline such that we can identify the components that contribute the most to the overall error.

\subsection{PLS}
This section describes the PLS aspect of the pipeline.

\subsubsection{Outlier Removal with Mahalanobis Distance and Chi-Squared Test}
% General programming language differences and implementation details
% Differences in outlier detection (automatic/quantitative vs manual/qualitative)
% Missing information about how three of the oxides are weighted in MOC result
% No manual cross validation in PLS
% Holdout split 80/20
% No inverse IRF weighing weighting in ICA
% Missing information about outlier removal in ICA - therefore we decided to not do it
% Missing information about how ICA uses each of the five datasets for each target
% How we do regression in ICA (since there are not enough details about it in the papers)

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:background}, if the Mahalanobis distances can be shown to form a chi-squared distribution, then the chi-squared test can be used to determine whether a sample is an outlier.
Since we do not have the expertize to make a qualitative assessment of the outliers, we have instead decided to use this property of the Mahalanobis distances to automatically detect outliers.
This works by computing the Mahalanobis distances for each sample in the training set, and then computing the chi-squared statistic for the Mahalanobis distances.
If the chi-squared statistic is greater than the critical value for the chi-squared distribution with $df$ degrees of freedom, then the sample is considered an outlier.
The critical value is determined by the significance level $\alpha$ and the number of degrees of freedom $df$.
Since we have leverage and residuals as our two dimensions, we have $df = 2$, because the number of dimensions is equal to the number of degrees of freedom\cite{aggarwal_outlier_2017}.
% TODO: Describe why we chose the degrees of freedom we did, and how we used this chi-squared test to determine outliers.

The outlier removal process is done iteratively because of the phenomenon described in \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017} where removing outliers can cause new outliers to appear.
The process is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compute the Mahalanobis distances for each sample in the training set.
	\item Compute the chi-squared statistic for the Mahalanobis distances.
	\item Remove the samples that are outliers.
	\item Train a new model on the remaining samples.
	\item Repeat from step 1 until the chi-squared statistic is less than the critical value.
\end{enumerate}

It should be noted that our outlier removal process is conservative to avoid removing too many samples and as such, we have set our significance level $\alpha$ to 0.975.
This means that we are willing to accept a 2.5\% chance of falsely removing a sample that is not an outlier.

\subsection{ICA}
This section describes the ICA aspect of the pipeline.

\subsubsection{Data Preprocessing}
Similar to the original pipeline, we have used the 408 samples from the ChemCam calibration dataset.
Before performing ICA, we have to preprocess this data.
As in section \ref{sec:...}, we start by masking the data such that the spectral-range edges are removed. %TODO: update reference when PLS section is done
Then we normalize the data using either Norm1 or Norm3.
These steps are identical to the original pipeline described by \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017}.

However, we do not weigh by the inverse of the instrument response function (IRF) as mentioned in \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017} before normalizing.
The reason for this is twofold.
First of all, we do not actually have access to the IRF, so we cannot use it.
Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, even if we did have access to the IRF, the practical implications of weighing by the inverse of the IRF has been subject to criticism by some of the original authors since it effectively reintroduces the noise that was removed by applying the IRF in the first place.
As previously mentioned, the IRF is applied specifically to remove noise from the data during the processing of the EDR to CCS data.
Therefore, the weighing by the inverse of the IRF is not only unnecessary, but also counterproductive.

In addition, because \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017} does not mention how each of the five datasets are used for each target, we have decided to only use the first dataset for each target.
We are aware that this does not produce as good results as using all five datasets, however in the interest of not skewing the results in the wrong direction, we decided not to make any assumptions about how \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017} used the five datasets to produce their results.
Our goal is to test each of the components of the pipeline individually rather than trying to reproduce the results to absolute perfection.
The fact that we are able to perform Independent Component Analysis with the same algorithm as \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017} indicates that our recreation is accurate enough for our purposes of identifying the components that contribute the most to the overall error.

Similarly, in our recreation of the pipeline, we have not incorporated outlier detection in the ICA part of the pipeline primarily because \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017} does not describe their implementation sufficiently enough for precise replication.
They mention the use of Median Absolute Deviation for this purpose, but the specifics of their approach remain unclear.
Our decision to omit outlier detection in the ICA phase of our pipeline is also influenced by a preference for retaining a more comprehensive dataset, despite the potential inclusion of outliers.
Further supporting this decision is input from one of the original authors involved in the PLS aspect of the project.
This author highlighted the extensive efforts invested in developing the ChemCam calibration dataset, suggesting a low probability of significant outlier presence.
Given this context, introducing outlier detection for the ICA phase based on mere assumptions would be counterproductive, potentially compromising the integrity of our analysis.

\subsection{Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigenmatrices (JADE) and Regression}
After preprocessing the data, we are ready to perform ICA.
This is done using the JADE algorithm, which is the same algorithm used by \citeauthor{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017}.
After performing ICA, we perform regression on the independent components to predict the oxide composition.

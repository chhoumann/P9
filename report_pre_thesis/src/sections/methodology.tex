\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}
% Method / Our Contribution (Detailed main part of the story, or how the analysis was done)
% Purpose: To explain the differences between the original pipeline and our attempt at reproducing it.
Since we did not have access to the original pipeline, we have attempted to recreate it based on the available information in \cite{}.
However, these papers did not include all the details of the pipeline, so we have had to make some assumptions and creative decisions ourselves.
In addition, some aspects of the pipeline rely on qualitative assessments made by the original authors - something we cannot do because we are not domain experts.
Consequently, our pipeline is not identical to the original, but we have tried to make it as close as possible.

This section is dedicated to describing the methodology of our pipeline, how it differs from the original, and which design choices we have made and why.
Furthermore, we delve into the experiments we have conducted to evaluate the performance of our pipeline such that we can identify the components that contribute the most to the overall error.

\textit{Recreate the current model. Reproduce the results of the original papers. Investigate the limitations of the model and propose improvements.}

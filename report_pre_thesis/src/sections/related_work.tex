Quantitative analysis of LIBS spectra is a well-studied problem.
The LIBS community has developed a variety of techniques to address this problem, including calibration-free LIBS (CF-LIBS), partial least squares (PLS) regression, independent component analysis (ICA), and artificial neural networks (ANNs).

There is no agreed-upon state of the art method for quantitative analysis of LIBS spectra, as different methods have been shown to perform better than others depending on the application.

% Connect the above introduction with the background section because it explains what Anderson et al. did and why they did it.

Since then, there have been several studies that have tried to address the limitations of the approach used by Anderson et al. 2017.

Takashi et al. reviewed evaluated methods for correcting matrix effects and self-absorption in the quantitative analysis of solid compositions via LIBS.
They found that while traditional calibration methods for LIBS face challenges with complex in-situ samples, CF-LIBS is limited by the need for prior sample knowledge.
Multivariate analysis techniques like PCR and PLS handle matrix effects well but struggle with non-linearities like self-absorption.
Despite limited research into the use of ANNs for quantitative analysis of solid samples, they found that ANN showed potential to overcome these issues because ANNs are able to learn the non-linear relationship between the LIBS spectra and the composition of the sample.
However, ANNs is limited by the need for a large number of training samples.
They conclude that simpler matrices favor theory-based methods, and more complex samples benefit from flexible statistical approaches, with computational advancements promising further improvements in LIBS analysis.

Lepore et al. examine how dividing LIBS spectra into submodels, as presented in Anderson, impacts the prediction of major element compositions.
Their findings highlight that, although submodeling is a promising approach, lower Root Mean Square Errors of Prediction (RMSEP) are often obtained when using the entire spectrum, indicating that a comprehensive dataset generally leads to more accurate geochemical analysis.

\begin{abstract}
This thesis advances the analysis of \gls{libs} data for predicting major oxide compositions in geological samples.
By integrating machine learning techniques and ensemble regression models, the study addresses challenges like high dimensionality, multicollinearity, and limited data availability.
Key innovations include the use of stacked generalization for improved model performance and an automated hyperparameter optimization framework.
The research contributes a comprehensive catalog of models and preprocessing techniques, and integrates findings into the \gls{pyhat} by the \gls{usgs}, enhancing its scientific capabilities.
This work lays a robust foundation for future advancements in geochemical analysis and planetary exploration using \gls{libs} data.

  abstract     = {Accurate quantitative analysis of diverse geologic materials is one of the primary challenges faced by the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)-based ChemCam instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. The SuperCam instrument on the Mars 2020 rover, as well as other LIBS instruments developed for geochemical analysis on Earth or other planets, will face the same challenge. Consequently, part of the ChemCam science team has focused on the development of improved multivariate analysis calibrations methods. Developing a single regression model capable of accurately determining the composition of very different target materials is difficult because the response of an element's emission lines in LIBS spectra can vary with the concentration of other elements. We demonstrate a conceptually simple “sub-model” method for improving the accuracy of quantitative LIBS analysis of diverse target materials. The method is based on training several regression models on sets of targets with limited composition ranges and then “blending” these “sub-models” into a single final result. Tests of the sub-model method show improvement in test set root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for almost all cases. The sub-model method, using partial least squares (PLS) regression, is being used as part of the current ChemCam quantitative calibration, but the sub-model method is applicable to any multivariate regression method and may yield similar improvements.},

  abstract     = {The ChemCam Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity has obtained {$>$}300,000 spectra of rock and soil analysis targets since landing at Gale Crater in 2012, and the spectra represent perhaps the largest publicly-available LIBS datasets. The compositions of the major elements, reported as oxides (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O), have been re-calibrated using a laboratory LIBS instrument, Mars-like atmospheric conditions, and a much larger set of standards (408) that span a wider compositional range than previously employed. The new calibration uses a combination of partial least squares (PLS1) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms, together with a calibration transfer matrix to minimize differences between the conditions under which the standards were analyzed in the laboratory and the conditions on Mars. While the previous model provided good results in the compositional range near the average Mars surface composition, the new model fits the extreme compositions far better. Examples are given for plagioclase feldspars, where silicon was significantly over-estimated by the previous model, and for calcium-sulfate veins, where silicon compositions near zero were inaccurate. The uncertainties of major element abundances are described as a function of the abundances, and are overall significantly lower than the previous model, enabling important new geochemical interpretations of the data.},

  abstract     = {The SuperCam instrument on the Perseverance Mars 2020 rover uses a pulsed 1064~nm laser to ablate targets at a distance and conduct laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) by analyzing the light from the resulting plasma. SuperCam LIBS spectra are preprocessed to remove ambient light, noise, and the continuum signal present in LIBS observations. Prior to quantification, spectra are masked to remove noisier spectrometer regions and spectra are normalized to minimize signal fluctuations and effects of target distance. In some cases, the spectra are also standardized or binned prior to quantification. To determine quantitative elemental compositions of diverse geologic materials at Jezero crater, Mars, we use a suite of 1198 laboratory spectra of 334 well-characterized reference samples. The samples were selected to span a wide range of compositions and include typical silicate rocks, pure minerals (e.g., silicates, sulfates, carbonates, oxides), more unusual compositions (e.g., Mn ore and sodalite), and replicates of the sintered SuperCam calibration targets (SCCTs) onboard the rover. For each major element (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O), the database was subdivided into five “folds” with similar distributions of the element of interest. One fold was held out as an independent test set, and the remaining four folds were used to optimize multivariate regression models relating the spectrum to the composition. We considered a variety of models, and selected several for further investigation for each element, based primarily on the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) on the test set, when analyzed at 3~m. In cases with several models of comparable performance at 3~m, we incorporated the SCCT performance at different distances to choose the preferred model. Shortly after landing on Mars and collecting initial spectra of geologic targets, we selected one model per element. Subsequently, with additional data from geologic targets, some models were revised to ensure results that are more consistent with geochemical constraints. The calibration discussed here is a snapshot of an ongoing effort to deliver the most accurate chemical compositions with SuperCam LIBS.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, various machine learning methods have been applied to improve the accuracy of quantitative analysis in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) by modelling the complex relationship between spectral intensity and analyte concentration. However, machine learning methods tend to have high model complexity and are difficult to interpret their predictions. Moreover, their decision-making mechanisms rarely consider the physical principles behind quantitative analysis, resulting in a reduction of {LIBS} quantification accuracy and a question of trust in the quantification results. This work investigates the feasibility of incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning to improve {LIBS} quantification performance. A new regression method based on dominant factor and kernel extreme learning machine is proposed, namely {DF}-K-{ELM}. It uses knowledge-based spectral lines, related to analyte compositions, to construct a linear physical principle based model and adopts K-{ELM} to account for the residuals of the linear model. {DF}-K-{ELM} intuitively explains how knowledge-based spectral lines influence prediction results and improves model interpretability without reducing model complexity. The proposed method, {DF}-K-{ELM}, is tested on 10 regression tasks based on 3 {LIBS} datasets and compared with 6 baseline methods. It achieves the best and second best performance on 4 and 2 tasks, respectively. Moreover, compared to traditional machine learning methods, dominant factor based methods yield higher accuracy in most cases. Such results demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning is a viable approach to improve the performance of {LIBS} quantification.},

	abstract = {As an in-situ and stand-off detection technique, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) can perform efficient geochemical sample identification and classification with chemometrics, and therefore {LIBS} has played a shining role in planetary exploration missions. Unlike in laboratory experiments, the {LIBS} sampling distance in field detection for planetary exploration naturally varies. The considerable spectral differences caused by the varying distance can be a critical challenge for chemometrics model training and testing. In this research, we address this issue by focusing on the construction of a chemometrics model with powerful learning ability rather than the conventional spectral data processing for distance correction. Specifically, we have investigated the performance of a designed deep convolutional neural network ({CNN}) on datasets consisting of multi-distance spectra. More than 18,000 {LIBS} spectra were collected by a duplicate model of the {MarSCoDe} instrument for China's Tianwen-1 Mars mission, at eight different distances ranging from 2.0 m to 5.0 m. These spectra were acquired from 39 geochemical standard samples, which were classified by the deep {CNN}. The competence of the {CNN} is compared with that of four alternative chemometrics, i. e. back-propagation neural network, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, and logistic regression. The {CNN} can surpass the other four algorithms in terms of overall prediction accuracy. In addition, we have inspected the dependence of the {CNN} performance on the distance number involved in the training set and the data properties of the testing set. Furthermore, it has been revealed that the {CNN} model can behave even better if an extremely simple distance correction procedure is supplemented. Our results show that {CNN} is an extraordinary chemometrics for material classification on multi-distance spectra datasets, implying that {CNN}-{LIBS} is a promising methodology for geochemical sample identification/classification in Tianwen-1 mission and other future planetary exploration missions, and in even more field detection scenarios with varying sampling distance.},

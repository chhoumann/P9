  abstract     = {Accurate quantitative analysis of diverse geologic materials is one of the primary challenges faced by the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)-based ChemCam instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover. The SuperCam instrument on the Mars 2020 rover, as well as other LIBS instruments developed for geochemical analysis on Earth or other planets, will face the same challenge. Consequently, part of the ChemCam science team has focused on the development of improved multivariate analysis calibrations methods. Developing a single regression model capable of accurately determining the composition of very different target materials is difficult because the response of an element's emission lines in LIBS spectra can vary with the concentration of other elements. We demonstrate a conceptually simple “sub-model” method for improving the accuracy of quantitative LIBS analysis of diverse target materials. The method is based on training several regression models on sets of targets with limited composition ranges and then “blending” these “sub-models” into a single final result. Tests of the sub-model method show improvement in test set root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) for almost all cases. The sub-model method, using partial least squares (PLS) regression, is being used as part of the current ChemCam quantitative calibration, but the sub-model method is applicable to any multivariate regression method and may yield similar improvements.},

The compositions of the major elements, reported as oxides (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O), have been re-calibrated using a laboratory LIBS instrument, Mars-like atmospheric conditions, and a much larger set of standards (408) that span a wider compositional range than previously employed. The new calibration uses a combination of partial least squares (PLS1) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms, together with a calibration transfer matrix to minimize differences between the conditions under which the standards were analyzed in the laboratory and the conditions on Mars. While the previous model provided good results in the compositional range near the average Mars surface composition, the new model fits the extreme compositions far better. Examples are given for plagioclase feldspars, where silicon was significantly over-estimated by the previous model, and for calcium-sulfate veins, where silicon compositions near zero were inaccurate. The uncertainties of major element abundances are described as a function of the abundances, and are overall significantly lower than the previous model, enabling important new geochemical interpretations of the data.},

  abstract     = {The SuperCam instrument on the Perseverance Mars 2020 rover uses a pulsed 1064~nm laser to ablate targets at a distance and conduct laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) by analyzing the light from the resulting plasma. SuperCam LIBS spectra are preprocessed to remove ambient light, noise, and the continuum signal present in LIBS observations. Prior to quantification, spectra are masked to remove noisier spectrometer regions and spectra are normalized to minimize signal fluctuations and effects of target distance. In some cases, the spectra are also standardized or binned prior to quantification. To determine quantitative elemental compositions of diverse geologic materials at Jezero crater, Mars, we use a suite of 1198 laboratory spectra of 334 well-characterized reference samples. The samples were selected to span a wide range of compositions and include typical silicate rocks, pure minerals (e.g., silicates, sulfates, carbonates, oxides), more unusual compositions (e.g., Mn ore and sodalite), and replicates of the sintered SuperCam calibration targets (SCCTs) onboard the rover. For each major element (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, FeOT, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O), the database was subdivided into five “folds” with similar distributions of the element of interest. One fold was held out as an independent test set, and the remaining four folds were used to optimize multivariate regression models relating the spectrum to the composition. We considered a variety of models, and selected several for further investigation for each element, based primarily on the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) on the test set, when analyzed at 3~m. In cases with several models of comparable performance at 3~m, we incorporated the SCCT performance at different distances to choose the preferred model. Shortly after landing on Mars and collecting initial spectra of geologic targets, we selected one model per element. Subsequently, with additional data from geologic targets, some models were revised to ensure results that are more consistent with geochemical constraints. The calibration discussed here is a snapshot of an ongoing effort to deliver the most accurate chemical compositions with SuperCam LIBS.},

Additional instrument components include a 6 m optical fiber which transfers the {LIBS} light from the telescope to the body unit, and a set of onboard calibration targets. {ChemCam} was integrated and tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory where it also underwent {LIBS} calibration with 69 geological standards prior to integration with the rover. Post-integration testing used coordinated mast and instrument commands, including {LIBS} line scans on rock targets during system-level thermal-vacuum tests.

  abstract     = {During the last decade, various machine learning methods have been applied to improve the accuracy of quantitative analysis in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) by modelling the complex relationship between spectral intensity and analyte concentration. However, machine learning methods tend to have high model complexity and are difficult to interpret their predictions. Moreover, their decision-making mechanisms rarely consider the physical principles behind quantitative analysis, resulting in a reduction of {LIBS} quantification accuracy and a question of trust in the quantification results. This work investigates the feasibility of incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning to improve {LIBS} quantification performance. A new regression method based on dominant factor and kernel extreme learning machine is proposed, namely {DF}-K-{ELM}. It uses knowledge-based spectral lines, related to analyte compositions, to construct a linear physical principle based model and adopts K-{ELM} to account for the residuals of the linear model. {DF}-K-{ELM} intuitively explains how knowledge-based spectral lines influence prediction results and improves model interpretability without reducing model complexity. The proposed method, {DF}-K-{ELM}, is tested on 10 regression tasks based on 3 {LIBS} datasets and compared with 6 baseline methods. It achieves the best and second best performance on 4 and 2 tasks, respectively. Moreover, compared to traditional machine learning methods, dominant factor based methods yield higher accuracy in most cases. Such results demonstrate that incorporating domain knowledge into machine learning is a viable approach to improve the performance of {LIBS} quantification.},

  abstract     = {As an in-situ and stand-off detection technique, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy ({LIBS}) can perform efficient geochemical sample identification and classification with chemometrics, and therefore {LIBS} has played a shining role in planetary exploration missions. Unlike in laboratory experiments, the {LIBS} sampling distance in field detection for planetary exploration naturally varies. The considerable spectral differences caused by the varying distance can be a critical challenge for chemometrics model training and testing. In this research, we address this issue by focusing on the construction of a chemometrics model with powerful learning ability rather than the conventional spectral data processing for distance correction. Specifically, we have investigated the performance of a designed deep convolutional neural network ({CNN}) on datasets consisting of multi-distance spectra. More than 18,000 {LIBS} spectra were collected by a duplicate model of the {MarSCoDe} instrument for China's Tianwen-1 Mars mission, at eight different distances ranging from 2.0 m to 5.0 m. These spectra were acquired from 39 geochemical standard samples, which were classified by the deep {CNN}. The competence of the {CNN} is compared with that of four alternative chemometrics, i. e. back-propagation neural network, support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, and logistic regression. The {CNN} can surpass the other four algorithms in terms of overall prediction accuracy. In addition, we have inspected the dependence of the {CNN} performance on the distance number involved in the training set and the data properties of the testing set. Furthermore, it has been revealed that the {CNN} model can behave even better if an extremely simple distance correction procedure is supplemented. Our results show that {CNN} is an extraordinary chemometrics for material classification on multi-distance spectra datasets, implying that {CNN}-{LIBS} is a promising methodology for geochemical sample identification/classification in Tianwen-1 mission and other future planetary exploration missions, and in even more field detection scenarios with varying sampling distance.},

  abstract     = {Steel is a widely used material. Since steel has different properties and uses depending on the steel type, it is essential to accurately classify the steel types. LIBS is a promising technique for real-time classification due to its advantages such as rapid analysis and feasibility of measurement in air. However, enhancing the robustness of classification models is still challenging in industrial applications. This study investigates the effects of feature engineering on the robustness of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for industrial steel classification. To make LIBS applicable to the steel industry, a remote LIBS system was developed. The LIBS system was utilized to classify the six representative types of steel. To evaluate the performance of the LIBS system, the measurements were reproduced, with the same sample, at seven different laser energies. The robustness of the LIBS system was investigated by conducting experiments using various feature-engineering and learning-based algorithms on the LIBS data, with test datasets having laser energies different from those of the training datasets. The results indicate that the LIBS signal intensity ratio as the input data leads to a more robust classification model than using principal components or random forest-based datasets. In addition, the intensity ratios with similar upper-state energies were found to be more suitable input data for steel classification. These findings demonstrate the potential of the LIBS system for the highly accurate and robust classification of industrial-grade steel.}

  abstract     = {To meet the ever-increasing global demand for metals, new mineral deposits need to be discovered. However, as the exploration frontier progressively moves towards deeper buried prospective areas, sampling is becoming costlier and deposit discovery rates are in decline. New technologies and analytical procedures able to deliver fast, reliable, and cheaper samples, analysis, and data, compared to current procedures are therefore, crucial in decreasing the risk of exploration targeting and can represent a step change in mineral exploration. In this study we demonstrate how to emulate laboratory whole-rock geochemical data for major elements (Al, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Na, Si, and Ti) by averaging LIBS spot analyses performed over single, 1-mm spaced transects, that imitate downhole trajectories, along \textasciitilde 1-meter length drill core intervals for chemically, texturally, and mineralogically diverse rocks. Data was collected using a benchtop prototype LIBS instrument that could be reconfigured to fit within a ≥ 75~mm diameter drill hole. The prototype comprises a customised 8~ns pulsed 532~nm Nd:YAG laser with maximum pulse energy of 40~mJ at 5~Hz; two high-resolution spectrometers that together cover a spectral range from 190 to 830~nm, hence allowing all elements to be analysed; a motorised stage; and optics. Estimated LIBS geochemistry shows strong correlations with laboratory whole rock geochemistry for the selected major elements, particularly for Si, Al, and Na, and to a lesser extent K, although the LIBS estimation can breakdown for elements found in low concentrations (e.g., 0.06~wt\%). Factors including the variability in mineralogy and element deportment, or roughness of the analysed surface can result in under- or over-estimation in LIBS whole rock geochemistry. In addition, for more efficient data collection processes, investigations of the optimal number of LIBs spot analysis showed that optimal \textasciitilde 30 to \textasciitilde 560 spot analyses per meter are required to emulate whole rock geochemistry (e.g., 1~\% error and 95~\% confidence). The strongest influence on the optimal number of LIBS analysis required for estimation of whole rock geochemistry is the range of element concentration and to a lesser extent the number of minerals that host an element as well as grain size. The results of this study show promise in development of strategies for rapid whole rock geochemical analysis down a drill hole.}

  abstract     = {With the ChemCam instrument, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has successively contributed to Mars exploration by determining the elemental compositions of soils, crusts, and rocks. The American Perseverance rover and the Chinese Zhurong rover respectively landed on Mars on February 18 and May 15, 2021, further increase the number of LIBS instruments on Mars. Such an unprecedented situation requires a reinforced research effort on the methods of LIBS spectral data analysis. Although the matrix effects correspond to a general issue in LIBS, they become accentuated in the case of rock analysis for Mars exploration, because of the large variation of rock compositions leading to the chemical matrix effect, and the difference in surface physical properties between laboratory standards (in pressed powder pellet, glass or ceramic) used to establish calibration models and natural rocks encountered on Mars, leading to the physical matrix effect. The chemical matrix effect has been tackled in the ChemCam project with large sets of laboratory standards offering a good representation of various compositions of Mars rocks. The present work more specifically deals with the physical matrix effect which is still lacking a satisfactory solution. The approach consists in introducing transfer learning in LIBS data treatment. For the specific application of total alkali-silica (TAS) classification of rocks (either with a polished surface or in the raw state), the results show a significant improvement in the ability to predict of pellet-based models when trained together with suitable information from rocks in a procedure of transfer learning. The correct TAS classification rate increases from 25\% for polished rocks and 33.3\% for raw rocks with a machine learning model, to 83.3\% with a transfer learning model for both types of rock samples.},

  abstract     = {The stream sediment (SS) records evolution information of the water system structure and sedimentary environment in specific regions during different geological periods, which is of great significance for studying the ancient planetary environment and the law of water system changes. Based on the SS of different geographical environments on Earth, remote laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (remote-LIBS) technology combined with the multidimensional scaling-back propagation neural network (MDS-BPNN) algorithm was used to conduct an in-depth analysis of remote qualitative and quantitative detection of the elemental composition and content of SS. The results show that the detection system based on remote LIBS combined with an artificial neural network algorithm can achieve an ideal quantitative analysis of major and trace elements. The coefficients of determination (R2) of the test set for major elements is greater than 0.9996, and the root mean square error (RMSE) is less than 0.7325. The coefficients of determination (R2) of the test set for trace elements is greater than 0.9837, and the root mean square error is less than 42.21. In addition, for the application scenario of exploring extraterrestrial life, biominerals represented by stromatolite phosphorite (SP) are easy to form sand and enter into SS under weathering. Therefore, this paper discusses the feasibility of using remote-LIBS technology to detect and identify such minerals under the disappearance of SPs’ macro- and micro-characteristics. From our research, we can find that remote-LIBS technology is the preferred candidate for discovering dust-covered biominerals. In geological environments rich in water system sedimentary rocks, such as Mars’ ancient riverbeds, LIBS technology is crucial for deciphering the “life signals” hidden in the Martian sand. © 2023 by the authors.},

  abstract     = {The accuracy of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) methods for analyzing geological samples is improved when calibration standards and unknown targets are compositionally similar. A recent study suggests that customized submodels can be used to optimize calibration datasets to achieve more accurate predictions [1]. In practice, this is difficult to implement because the errors inherent in the methods used for sorting unknown targets by composition may affect how successfully this matching can occur. Moreover, creation of submodels intrinsically reduces the size of the dataset on which the model is trained, which has been shown to reduce prediction accuracy. This paper uses LIBS spectra of 2990 unique rock powder standards to compare the accuracy of 1) submodels generated for each element over its geochemical range, 2) submodels created using SiO2 content only, 3) submodels created using the ratio of Si(II)/Si(I) emission lines to group spectra by a proxy for approximate plasma temperature, and 4) models created using all data. Results indicate that prediction accuracies are not always improved by creating submodels because subdividing a dataset to optimize calibrations will always result in a smaller database available for each submodel, and the reduced training set size negatively affects accuracy. Customized LIBS standards for specific applications might overcome this problem in cases where the matrix is similar and the expected concentration range is known. But in a majority of geochemical applications, submodel approaches are only useful in improving prediction accuracies when the initial database is itself extensive enough to support large, robust submodel calibration suites.}

Still, the performance for quantification purposes remains its major caveat, obstructing a broader application of the technique. In this work, we present an extensive comparison of the performances of distinct algorithms for quantification of Lithium in a mining prospection stage, using spectra acquired with both a commercial handheld device and a laboratory prototype. Covering both linear and non-linear methodologies, the results show that, when covering a wide range of concentrations typical on a mining operation, non-linear methodologies manage to achieve errors compatible with a semi-quantitative performance, offering performances better than those obtained with linear methods, which are more affected by saturation and matrix effects. The findings enclosed offer support for future applications in the field and may possibly be generalized for other elements of interest in similar mining environments.}

  abstract     = {A Mars Surface Composition Detector (MarSCoDe) instrument mounted on Zhurong rover of Tianwen-1, adopts Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), with no sample preparation or dust and coatings ablation required, to conduct rapid multi-elemental analysis and characterization of minerals, rocks and soils on the surface of Mars. To test the capability of MarSCoDe LIBS measurement and quantitative analysis, some methods of multivariate analysis on olivine samples with gradient concentrations were inspected based on the spectra acquired in a Mars-simulated environment before the rover launch in 2020. Firstly, LIBS spectra need preprocessing, including background subtraction, random signal denoising, continuum baseline removal, spectral drift correction and wavelength calibration, radiation calibration, and multi-channel spectra subset merging. Then, the quantitative analysis with univariate linear regression (ULR) and multivariate linear regression (MLR) are performed on the characteristic lines, while principal component regression (PCR), partial least square regression (PLSR), ridge, least-absolute-shrinkage-and-selection-operator (LASSO) and elastic net, and nonlinear analysis with back-propagation (BP) are conducted on the entire spectral information. Finally, the performance on the quantitative olivine analyzed by MarSCoDe LIBS is compared with the mean spectrum and all spectra for each sample and evaluated by some statistical indicators. The results show that: (1) the calibration curve of ULR constructed by the characteristic line of magnesium and iron indicates the linear relationship between the spectral signal and the element concentration, and the limits of detection of forsterite and fayalite is 0.9943 and 2.0536 (c\%) analyzed by mean spectra, and 2.3354 and 3.8883 (c\%) analyzed by all spectra; (2) the R2 value on the calibration and validation of all the methods is close to 1, and the predicted concentration estimated by these calibration models is close to the true concentration; (3) the shrinkage or regularization technique of ridge, LASSO and elastic net perform better than the ULR and MLR, except for ridge overfitting on the testing sample; the best results can be obtained by the dimension reduction technique of PCR and PLSR, especially with PLSR; and BP is more applicable for the sample measured with larger spectral dataset.},

  abstract     = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) coupled with chemometrics is an efficient method for rock identification and classification, which has considerable potential in planetary geology. A great challenge facing the LIBS community is the difficulty to accurately discriminate rocks with close chemical compositions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model has been designed in this study to identify twelve types of rock, among which some rocks have similar compositions. Both the training set and the testing set are constructed based on the LIBS spectra acquired by Mars Surface Composition Detector (MarSCoDe) for China’s Tianwen-1 Mars exploration mission. All the spectra were collected from dedicated rock pellet samples, which were placed in a simulated Martian atmospheric environment. The classification performance of the CNN has been compared with that of three alternative machine learning algorithms, i.e., logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Among the four methods, it is on the CNN model that the highest classification correct rate has been obtained, as assessed by precision score, recall score, and the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Furthermore, the classification accuracy is inspected more quantitatively via Brier score, and the CNN is still the best performing model. The results demonstrate that the CNN-based chemometrics are an efficient tool for rock identification with LIBS spectra collected in a simulated Martian environment. Despite the relatively small sample set, this study implies that CNN-supported LIBS classification is a promising analytical technique for Tianwen-1 Mars mission and more planetary explorations in the future.},

These two questions are key issues for geology applications including ore grading in mining operations and typically lead to sub-optimal results. In this work, we present the implementation of a class of clustered regression calibration algorithms, that previously search the sample space looking for similar samples before employing a linear calibration model that is trained for that cluster. For a case study involving lithium quantification in three distinct exploration drills, the obtained results demonstrate that building local models can improve the performance of standard linear models in particular in the lower concentration region. Furthermore, we show that the models generalize well for unseen data of exploration drills on distinct rock veins, which can motivate not only further research on this class of methods but also technological applications for similar mining environments.}

It is the responsibility of the data analyst to formulate the scientific issue at hand in terms of PC projections, PLS regressions, etc. Ask yourself, or the investigator, why the data matrix was collected, and for what purpose the experiments and measurements were made. Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.}

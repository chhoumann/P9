\subsubsection{Decision Trees}
A decision tree is a supervised learning model that partitions data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree structure.
The goal is to create a tree that predicts the target variable by dividing the data into increasingly homogeneous subsets.
Each internal node in the tree represents a decision based on a specific feature, while each leaf node represents a prediction for the target variable.
The tree can make predictions for new data points by following a path from the root to a leaf node\cite{James2023AnIS}.

\subsubsection{Ensemble Learning}
Ensemble learning is a technique in machine learning where multiple models, known as \textit{weak learners}, are combined to produce more accurate predictions.
Mathematically, ensemble learning can be defined as combining the predictions of $M$ weak learners to form a final prediction $\hat{y}$, such that:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{y} = \sum_{m=1}^{M} \alpha_m \hat{y}_m,
\end{equation}
where $\hat{y}_m$ is the prediction of the $m$-th weak learner and $\alpha_m$ is the weight assigned to the $m$-th weak learner.
While there are various choices for weak learners, decision trees are a common choice\cite{James2023AnIS}.

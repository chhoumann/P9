\subsubsection{Ensemble Learning}
Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple models, referred to as weak learners, to generate more accurate predictions.
Individually, the predictive ability of weak learners may be limited, but when combined, they can produce a more precise and robust model.
Ensemble learning encompasses several methods, including bagging, boosting, and stacking\cite{James2023AnIS, pavlyshenko2018stacking}

In this section, we provide an overview of the ensemble learning methods used in this work.
We begin by introducing decision trees, a commonly used weak learner in ensemble methods.

\subsubsection{Ensemble Learning}
Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple models, referred to as weak learners, to generate more accurate predictions.
Individually, weak learners might have limited performance, but their combination can lead to a more precise and robust model.
Decision trees are often chosen as weak learners due to their simplicity and effectiveness.
Ensemble learning encompasses several methods, including bagging, boosting, and stacking\cite{James2023AnIS, pavlyshenko2018stacking}

In this section, we provide an overview of the ensemble learning methods used in this work.

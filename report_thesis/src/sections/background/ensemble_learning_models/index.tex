\subsection{Ensemble Learning Models}
In this section we introduce the concept of ensemble learning and decision trees based on \citet{James2023AnIS}, as they are fundamental aspects of the ensemble learning models we discuss.
Following this, we outline \gls{etr}, \gls{gbr}, \gls{ngboost}, and \gls{xgboost}.

\subsection{Linear and Regularization Models}
Linear models are a class of models that assume a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable.
These models are simple and interpretable, making them a popular choice for regression tasks.
Regularization is used to prevent overfitting through the addition of a penalty term to the loss function\cite{James2023AnIS}.

In this section, we provide an overview of the linear and regularization models used in this work.

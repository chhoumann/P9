\subsubsection{Ordinary Least Squares Regression}
We briefly cover the \gls{ols} regression algorithm based on \citet{James2023AnIS} to provide context for the subsequent discussions on linear and regularization models.
\gls{ols} regression is a linear regression technique that fits a linear model to a dataset.
It does this by estimating the coefficients that minimize the objective function, specifically the sum of squared differences between the observed target values and the predicted values.
This method is the most common approach used to fit a linear regression model to a dataset and is widely employed in practice.
\gls{ols} assumes that there is no multicollinearity among the input features.

\subsection{Preprocessing}
In this subsection, we discuss the preprocessing methods used in our machine learning pipeline.
We cover various normalization techniques such as Z-score normalization, max absolute scaling, min-max normalization, robust scaling, Norm 3, power transformation, and quantile transformation.
These techniques are essential for standardizing data, handling different scales, and improving the performance of machine learning models.

\subsubsection{Quantile Transformer}
Quantile transformation is a method that applies a non-linear transformation to map data to a uniform or normal distribution.
This process involves mapping the data $X$ to a set of probabilities $p$ using the \gls{cdf}, which indicates the probability that a random variable will be less than or equal to a specific value in $X$'s original distribution.
Subsequently, the quantile function, which is the inverse of the \gls{cdf} of the desired distribution, is applied to these probabilities $p$ to generate the transformed data.
This method forces the data to conform to the specified distribution regardless of the original distribution's form~\cite{Vasques2024}.

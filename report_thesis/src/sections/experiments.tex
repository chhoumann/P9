\section{Experiments}
To evaluate the performance of the proposed models, we conducted a series of experiments on the \gls{libs} data.
Experiments were conducted on a machine equipped with an Intel Xeon Gold 6242 CPU, featuring 16 cores and 32 threads.
The CPU has a base clock speed of 2.80 GHz and a maximum turbo frequency of 3.90 GHz.
The system has 64 GB of RAM and runs on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS.
Models were implemented using Python 3.10.11.


% Notes to get you going:
% Experimental Setup:
% - Software and Hardware: Specify the software (including version numbers) and hardware used in the experiments to allow for reproducibility.
% - Configuration Details: For each model, describe the configuration settings such as learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, etc. and refer to apppendix for actual values
% - Training Process: Describe how each model was trained. Include details on the number of epochs, batch size, optimization techniques, and any regularization methods used.

\section{Experiments \& Results}\label{sec:methodology}
This section outlines the experimental design used to identify the top-$n$ models to be used for our stacking ensemble.
We begin with a description of the prerequisite data preparation necessary for all experiments, followed by an overview of the hardware and software used.
Then we provide a visual and statistical analysis to confirm that our data partitioning method works as intended, and effectively separates the extreme and non-extreme values.
Next, we outline the design of our initial experiment in Section~\ref{sec:initial-experiment}, which provides a preliminary assessment of the models selected in Section~\ref{sec:model_selection}.
The results of this initial experiment are then presented and discussed in Section~\ref{sec:initial_results}.
We then describe the design of our optimization experiment in Section~\ref{subsec:optimization_experiment_design}, which leverages our optimization framework to identify the top-$n$ models.
The results are then presented and discussed in Section~\ref{sec:optimization_results}.
Finally, we use the identified models to construct a stacking ensemble, which is then evaluated and compared to the individual models and our baseline in Section~\ref{subsec:stacking_ensemble}.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

NASA has been studying the Martian environment for decades through a series of missions, each building on the knowledge gained from the previous ones.
Today, the rovers exploring Mars are equipped with sophisticated instruments for analyzing the chemical composition of Martian soil in search of past life and habitable environments.

Part of this research is facilitated through interpretation of spectral data gathered  by \gls{libs} instruments.
\gls{libs} works by firing a high-powered laser at soil samples, creating a plasma that emits light captured by spectrometers and analyzed for its elemental composition through the use of machine learning models.
Scientists and researchers at NASA uses the spectral data to inform their understanding of Mars' geology through the identification of major oxides in the soil samples.
To this end, various machine learning models have been developed to predict the composition of major oxides in the sample.
However, the high dimensionality and multicollinearity of the spectral data remains a significant challenge for these models.
A detailed study into advanced machine learning models and dimensionality reduction techniques is therefore crucial for improving predictions in these applications.

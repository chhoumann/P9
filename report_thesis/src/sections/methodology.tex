\section{Methodology}\label{sec:methodology}
In this section, we outline the methodology used in this study to address the challenges identified in the problem definition. Our objective was to identify the most promising machine learning models and preprocessing techniques proposed from the literature, as outlined in Section~\ref{sec:related-work}, for predicting major oxide compositions from LIBS data.
Then, using this knowledge, develop a pipeline that utilizes the strengths of these models and preprocessing techniques to improve prediction accuracy and robustness of the predictions.
We first describe the datasets used, including their preparation and the method of splitting for model training. Next, we outline the preprocessing steps and the model selection process, followed by a detailed explanation of the experimental setup and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss our validation testing procedures and the approach taken to ensure unbiased final model evaluations.

\subsection{Data Prepraration}
Similarly to our previous work \citet{p9_paper}, we used the publicly available \gls{ccs} data.
\gls{ccs} refers to \gls{libs} data that has been through a series of preprocessing steps such as subtracting the ambient light background, noise removal and removing the electron continuum to derive data that is more suitable for quantitative analysis.
The full description of this preprocessing can be found in \citet{wiensPreFlight3}.

While the \gls{ccs} data is in a more suitable form for quantitative analysis, it still requires further preprocessing.
The initial five shots from each sample are excluded because they are usually contaminated by dust covering the target, which is cleared away by the shock waves produced by the laser.
The remaining 45 shots from each location are then averaged, yielding a single spectrum per location and resulting in a total of five spectra for each target.

At this stage, the data still contains noise at the edges of the spectrometers.
These edges correspond to the boundaries of the three spectrometers, which collectively cover the \gls{uv}, \gls{vio}, and \gls{vnir} light spectra.
The noisy edge ranges are as follows: 240.811-246.635 nm, 338.457-340.797 nm, 382.138-387.859 nm, 473.184-492.427 nm, and 849-905.574 nm.
In addition to being noisy regions, these regions do not contain any useful information related to each of the major oxides.
Consequently, these regions are masked by zeroing out the values, rather than removing them, as they still provide valuable information for the model to learn from\cite{cleggRecalibrationMarsScience2017}.

Additionally, as a result of the aforementioned preprocessing applied to the raw \gls{libs} data, negative values are present in the \gls{ccs} data.
These negative values are not physically meaningful, since you cannot have negative light intensity.
Similar to the noisy edges, these negative values are also masked by zeroing out the values.

\subsection{Model and Preprocessing Selection}
For the initial investigative experiments, we selected a range of models for further exploration, namely \gls{svr}, \gls{gbr}, \gls{pls}, \gls{xgboost}, \gls{ngboost}, \gls{etr}, \gls{enet}, and \gls{sgd}.
We also included regular \gls{ann} and \gls{cnn} in this phase of experimentation.
This selection was guided primarily by the literature review but also by exploratory intuition, aiming to discover potentially innovative applications and performances within our specific dataset.

Our literature review highlighted various approaches and their effectiveness in handling the challenges associated with predicting major oxide compositions from \gls{libs} data.
For instance, \citet{andersonImprovedAccuracyQuantitative2017} discussed the use of multiple regression models, finding that different models excelled with specific oxides, which informed our model-specific approach.
\citet{song_DF-K-ELM} presented a hybrid model combining domain knowledge with machine learning, which inspired our interest in models that could offer both high performance and interpretability. \citet{rezaei_dimensionality_reduction} demonstrated the beneficial impact of dimensionality reduction techniques like \gls{pca}, which we considered essential for managing our high-dimensional \gls{libs} data.

All models demonstrated robust performance; however, \gls{gbr}, \gls{svr}, \gls{xgboost}, \gls{etr}, and \gls{pls} consistently excelled across all oxides.
Notably, we observed model-specific strengths for certain oxides --- \gls{svr} was particularly effective for \ce{SiO2}, while \gls{gbr} excelled with \ce{FeO_T}.
This differential performance prompted us to explore architectural frameworks that could systematically capitalize on the strengths of each model for specific oxides.

A particularly exciting discovery from our literature review was a study on the stacking and chaining of normalization methods initially aimed at classification contexts.
Inspired by these ideas, we explored the possibility of improving model performance by optimizing the preprocessing chain for each model, per oxide, in order to determine which normalization methods would be most beneficial.
For this purpose, we considered the following preprocessing techniques: Min-Max Scaling, Standard Scaling, Robust Scaling, MaxAbs Scaling, Quantile Transformer and Power Transformer.
Additionally, we also considered dimensionality reduction techniques such as \gls{pca} and \gls{kernel-pca}.
Through experimentation, we identified which preprocessing techniques were most effective for each model and oxide.
Realizing the potential of this, we decided to further investigate how the predictive accuracy and robustness could be improved by combining the strengths of these models and preprocessing techniques.
From our investigation, we determined that the stacking ensemble method seemed very promising and novel in the LIBS analysis field, leading us to select it as the primary method for our study.

Stacking ensemble is analogous to the methodologies employed in the original \gls{moc} pipeline, which also tailored predictions for each oxide by blending outputs from the \gls{pls1-sm} and \gls{ica} phases, variably weighting the influence of the \gls{ica} predictions depending on the oxide.
Unlike the \gls{moc} model, which required manual determination of the model weightings for each oxide, our method utilizes a meta learner to learn optimal parameter settings.
Stacking ensemble is beneficial as it dynamically adapts to our dataset's characteristics without the need for domain-specific knowledge.
This approach represents a more sophisticated method, streamlining complex model configurations and potentially enhancing predictive accuracy through dynamically learned integrations, rather than fixed presets.

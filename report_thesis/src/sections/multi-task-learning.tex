In their work \citet{caruana_no_1997}, presents a method called \textit{Multitask learning}, which is a method of learning machine models on several related datasets. 
The motivation for this approach stems from the assumption that utilizing multiple, albeit related, datasets can enhance the model's ability to discern patterns and shapes within the data.
\citet{caruana_no_1997} suggest that leveraging shared representations for model training can enable the model to identify underlying attributes in other data sets, even when this new data is small.
This is interesting to our report as one of the major challenges in analyzing LIBS calibration data for Mars is the scarcity of available data.
This scarcity makes it difficult to construct robust models capable of comprehensively understanding the underlying patterns and physical principles within the data.
Utilizing related LIBS data could help the models first learn the general outline, shape and patterns in the LIBS data, making it easier for it to grasp the deeper patterns in the Mars related data.

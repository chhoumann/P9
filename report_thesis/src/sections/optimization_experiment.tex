\section{Optimization Experiment}\label{sec:optimization_experiment}
In this section we outline the optimization experiment, where we aim to identify the top-$n$ best performing pipelines for each oxide.
We first outline the experiment design, where we describe the structure of the experiment, along with the hyperparameter ranges used.
Following this, we present the results of the optimization experiment, along with a discussion of the results.
This knowledge will be used to select the best performing pipelines per oxide, to be used in our stacking ensemble.

\section{Problem Definition}\label{sec:problem_definition}
There remains considerable uncertainty about which machine learning techniques best predict the composition of major oxides in Martian geological samples using \gls{libs} data.
In addition, predicting major oxide compositions from \gls{libs} data presents significant computational challenges, including the high dimensionality and non-linearity of the data, compounded by multicollinearity and the phenomenon known as matrix effects~\cite{andersonImprovedAccuracyQuantitative2017}.
These effects can cause the intensity of emission lines from an element to vary independently of that element's concentration, introducing unknown variables that complicate the analysis.
Furthermore, due to the high cost of data collection, datasets are often small, which further complicates the task of building accurate and robust models.

Building upon the baseline established in~\citet{p9_paper}, our work aims to address the significant challenges inherent in predicting major oxide compositions from \gls{libs} data by improving the accuracy and robustness of these predictions.
Here, we define accuracy as the ability of a model to predict the composition of major oxides in Martian geological samples, while robustness refers to the stability of these predictions across different samples and oxides.

To evaluate the performance of these models, we will use \gls{rmse} as a proxy for accuracy, defined by the equation:

\begin{equation}
	RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2},
\end{equation}

where $y_i$ represents the actual values, $\hat{y}_i$ the predicted values, and $n$ the number of observations.
We use \gls{rmse} as a measure of accuracy to quantify the difference between the predicted and actual values of the major oxides in the samples.

To address robustness, we will consider the standard deviation of prediction errors across each oxide and test instance, defined as:

\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{error} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (e_i - \bar{e})^2},
\end{equation}

where $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$ and $\bar{e}$ is the mean error.
We use the standard deviation of prediction errors to measure the variability of the prediction errors across each oxide and test instance, which provides a measure of the robustness of the model's predictions.

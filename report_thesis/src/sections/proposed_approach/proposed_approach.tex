\section{Proposed Approach}
To address the challenges in predicting major oxide compositions from \gls{libs} data, we propose the development of advanced computational models capable of effectively handling the multifaceted challenges arising from the high dimensionality of spectral data, multicollinearity, matrix effects, and limited data availability.
These issues complicate the accurate and robust prediction of elemental concentrations, necessitating advanced computational methodologies. 

Our approach aims to enhance the prediction accuracy and robustness for major oxides in \gls{libs} data by leveraging specific combinations of machine learning models and preprocessors that are particularly effective at predicting individual oxides.
The models will use feature vectors $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ where $N$ is the number of features, derived from the Masked Intensity Tensor $\mathbf{M}[\chi, l, \lambda]$ after processing by one or more preprocessors, and output Estimated Concentration Vectors $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_o}$. 
The effectiveness of our models will be evaluated using metrics such as \gls{rmse} for accuracy and the standard deviation of prediction errors for robustness.
These metrics will provide a comprehensive assessment of the models' performance in predicting the concentrations of major oxides in geological samples.

To ensure generalizability for our models, we will employ a k-fold cross-validation strategy, for partitioning the data into training and test sets.
However, as stated in Section~\ref{subsec:quantification} the Masked Intensity Tensor contains multiple locations for each sample.
This necessitates careful considerations when constructing each fold to prevent data leakage of location data across the training and test partitions.
To this end, we have devised a custom k-fold cross validation method to address this issue.

\section{Proposed Approach}
To address the challenges in predicting major oxide compositions from \gls{libs} data, we propose the development of advanced computational models capable of effectively handling the multifaceted challenges we describe in \ref{subsec:challenges}.
These issues complicate the accurate and robust prediction of elemental concentrations, necessitating advanced computational methodologies. 

Our approach aims to enhance the prediction accuracy and robustness for major oxides in \gls{libs} data by leveraging specific combinations of machine learning models and preprocessors that are particularly effective at predicting individual oxides.
The models will use feature vectors $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$, derived from the Masked Intensity Tensor $\mathbf{M}[\chi, l, \lambda]$ after processing by one or more preprocessors, and output Estimated Concentration Vectors $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_o}$. 
For each model, we calculate a vector of prediction errors $\mathbf{e}$, where each entry $e_i$ represents the difference between the actual and predicted concentration for the $i$-th oxide. Subsequently, for each oxide, we aggregate the corresponding prediction errors across all models to construct a vector. 
This results in $n$ vectors, each containing prediction errors for a specific oxide from all models.
Finally, we fit a mapping function $\mathcal{F}$ to the prediction error vectors for each oxide, to produce a final prediction for that oxide.
We use metrics such as \gls{rmse} for accuracy and the standard deviation of prediction errors for robustness to evaluate our models.

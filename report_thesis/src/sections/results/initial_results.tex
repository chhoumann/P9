\subsection{Initial Results}
As described in Section~\ref{sec:proposed_approach}, we conducted a series of initial experiments to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models on the prediction of major oxide compositions from our \gls{libs} dataset.
These experiments aimed to provide a preliminary assessment of the models' performance.
All models were trained on the same preprocessed data using the Norm 3 preprocessing method described in Section~\ref{sec:norm3}.
This ensured that the models' performance could be evaluated under consistent and comparable conditions.

Table~\ref{tab:init_results} presents the results of these experiments, including the \gls{rmsep}, \gls{rmsecv}, standard deviation, standard deviation of the cross-validation, and the mean of these metrics for each model and oxide.
Figure~\ref{fig:init_results_rmses} shows the mean \gls{rmsep} and \gls{rmsecv} for each model sorted in ascending order.
